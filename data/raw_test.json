It seems to me that I have used logic thus far only as a self serving tool for pleasure and comfort, all while rationalizing why not to use it to help others more effectively.\n\nUsing logic as a tool while having comfort as my core value has brought me a lot of stress because it has created a lack of harmony with my social environment. Logically, this wouldn't be a problem. The only problem is that I want the comfortable smooth waters of social harmony, while also applying reason and thus making very different choices than others to obtain the results I desire. This is **exactly** the inner battle I've been experiencing for so long. No one ever seemed to grasp it. It has bugged the hell out of me because this fear holds back a part of me that others in less fortunate situations could use so much. My own fears seem like big mental fabrications that in reality are so small and *truly* insignificant compared to the real suffering others are going through. It creates a lack in efficiency and effectiveness in my thoughts and actions.\n\nI am fascinated by the idea that when we have true understanding of a topic, that we don't need willpower to accomplish our objectives. I have experienced this to be true in some parts of my own life. It makes me wonder if only superficial convictions need willpower and create vulnerable belief systems that makes us feel very uncomfortable with reason simply because we understand so little of the things we believe in so strongly. \n\nA) The feeling of being torn appart by both the desire for comfort and logic, B) the realization that I could be so much more effective in problem solving, C) and the strong suspicion that understanding and logic, and behaving in accordance to that, doesn't need willpower, is all poking holes into the belief system or attitude in life that I have walked around with for as long as I remember. \n\nI would love to find some more resources pertaining these topics and I would really appreciate hearing insights of people who have already clicked. \n\nMaking reason my core value truly starts to seem like the only reasonable thing to do. \n\n\n","createdAt":1483122759,"score":3,"author":"Lilo__","id":"5l4yqo"},{"title":"Unofficial F.A.Q./statements to Clickers guide. (updates/feedback encouraged)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5kyzp4/unofficial_faqstatements_to_clickers_guide/","selftext":"**Purpose of this thread ultimately:\n'Helping others make the click.' \nIt is for new clickers and new readers mostly**\n\nWill try to keep the answers short but I think there are no good short answers to this. Athene is writing a book as well that addresses certain questions/concerns much better than I can. This is for both new clickers trying to explain and new readers. \n\nGenerally everyone should watch the debates /podcasts but I will try my best to alleviate it a bit. I question if my ultradian sleep cycle has influenced the decision to make this thread but I think it will help. (By the way clickers I highly advise you take a look at your sleep cycles/alertness/output. Look into polyphasic sleep. Sleep could be a key part of your life that has escaped the gaze of your logic.)\n\n I imagine others will have better questions and answers to what I post here which is fine. It is the existence of the thread and future updates to it is the goal. \n\nNoticed a lot of  new clickers have hard times communicating with other people about this. And a lot of questions go unanswered and they may appear to be more sensitive to the criticism. And this really collides with their need/will to share something new and awesome. So while I encourage you to think for yourself, do your own reading, listen to podcasts,read athene's book and read the wiki. This should help a bit on a basic level. You can remove my opinion in many cases and use additional insight from athene or yourself if you think that is best. https://logicnation.org/A_Simple_Click \n\nPeople often hate to read especially if it is something they aren't interested in. So sometimes it helps to address a few questions or concerns before directing them. It should be noted though when you speak to someone for their own benefit give them the benefit of the doubt but note people have different knee jerk reactions to this. \n\nIts important to note certain traits and why they may be this way. This includes current readers of this post. \n\n\n\n**Why is the video labelled 'Science finds God'?** \n\nThis may seem either like intentional click bait(pun intended) or a presumptuous statement. More importantly it depends on your definition of God. And also that the video takes a look into the field of neuro-theology. In laymans, Neurotheology is the field where the neurology and psychology of the brain is used to explain spiritual and religious phenomena. This helps explain the title.\n\nMost importantly is that people seem to miss the question mark in the video's title. Perceiving it as a statement even when it is given as a question seems to trigger some people or make them unwilling to understand. Make sure you or your friend actually watches the entire video before off shooting into long conversations in my opinion.  https://www.asimpleclick.org/\n\n**Is this a cult or doesn't Athene realize this can appear to be that way?** \n*There are so many answers to this on so many levels but I think a key point is; If you created something that could change peoples lives for the better on a fundamental level would you not try to help the world or would you not do it out of fear some people will call it a cult? I will leave you with that question to answer for yourself.* \n\n**Is this a scam?**\n\n*No one here including myself has been sold anything.* \n \n**Did Athene invent this/What makes Athene qualified to say these things?**\n\n*A major issue I have seen when people talk about this is they tend to focus on Athene and often attack his character. Athene did not invent spinozism or neuro-theology. His insight and efforts are however very invaluable.  \n\nI forget the official name for the bias but essentially many of us accept/believe good advice based on the source rather than the legitimacy/logic of what is being said. \n\nGodwin's law states the longer a discussion on the internet is the higher probability someone relates it to Hitler. \n\nRelating the bias and godwin's law together basically if you negative emotion with a leader and compare them to people you don't like for example Hitler or Trump or Putin for argument sake(in this case it may be athene). They could say a fact like \"Water = H2O\" and your mind will instinctively want to find ways to disagree and attack that statement.\n \n**This is a fad that will die out.** \n\n*Depends on your definition of fad but let us say that statement is true. It still does not devalue or marginalize the important work going on here. A lot of important revolutions were considered 'fads'.*\n\n**If everyone had logic as a core value then everyone would be robots.** \n\n*You can look at the podcasts,testimonies and athenes videos. I don't think anyone here appears to be a robot. Often when some people try to visualize very logical people they see a cold sociopathic scientist or a Spok/Vulcan like person. This is pretty far from the truth and it may be because you see logic as something cold and ruthless.*\n\nAlso look at the world and yourself honestly. This somehow scares you more than the atrocities going on right now? \n\n**I think I am already logical or perfect enough not to have to try this or be involved in it.** \n\n *This statement is often ego based. Assuming it isn't though, we often use logic as a tool to get us what we want both consciously and subconsciously. Some of those things are good, some are bad. Often we delude ourselves into thinking a lot of the bad is necessary or not that bad. It is very difficult for us to accept the ego has played a trick on us and the inner child is still pulling the strings. Definitely viewed myself as enlightened pre-click but this tends to put a new bar/definition on that term so still read/try it.* \n\n**I don't have time for this.**\n\n*Time is about priorities. If you have time for a couple youtube videos then you have enough time to try something that will potentially change your life for the better that is free. Your valuation of your time is likely coming from not the most logical motivations at any rate. For many clicking isn't necessarily a long process. But if it is for you then that is fine and I am sure the understandings you gain of yourself whether you click or not will be beyond worth the effort.*\n\nAfter clicking I have found I not only have more time(clearly by the size of this thread) but also that I perceive time a bit differently. I generally used to consider myself one of the busiest people around. Days generally feel slower but in a good way imo. \n\n**My friend can really benefit from clicking but I can't get through to them.** \n\nThe first time I spoke Athene about my click. He had one criticism for me which was I was not logically thinking about impact. At the time I felt like he just did not have enough information to say that, but some days later I realized he was right. \n\n*We all want to help our friends have better lives/beat addictions/anxiety/depression. But it makes more sense to spend 10 hours helping 10 people click rather than 10 hours trying to persuade one person.  And who knows maybe one of those people will help your friend or maybe once it becomes more common your friend will see the value in it and be more open.*  \n\nI know it is hard to accept this because clicking does not make you love your friends and family less. But help who you can help for now. Spending all your effort in one place with little to no effect is illogical. Sometimes leading by example is the best way you can help.\n\nEdit: In regards to this make sure you have exhausted your options in terms of the available media/info.\n\n**Will it make me or my friend emotionless.**\nClicking is actually an emotional process and after you click you should have a really good relationship with your emotions moving forward.\n\n**I am Skeptical or my friend is very skeptical.**\n\n *Personally I am a huge skeptic of well everything. Especially anything that has to do with religion or pseudo-science or spiritual 'woo'. There are times where skepticism is an important defense in a world with deceitful people and that is good. You should also ask yourself exactly why you or the person you are speaking to is so pain-stakingly skeptical.* \n\nHave they been hurt before?\nScammed before?\nHave a fear of things of this nature?\nTried many things that failed?\nDoes not see you as an authority to attempt to help them?\nDo they want to maintain some authority on you by appearing more intelligent? \nIs it ego based skepticism?\n\n*There is little you can do to change this fear in yourself or others apart from ironically 'clicking'. For now however the main thing is to use that skepticism to understand all the information,insight and testimonies presented then make a decision. Lazy skepticism is the worst kind and often comes from a knee jerk reaction or a weak place.*  \n\n\nDefinitely think this could be more concise but again the goal of this thread is so that a couple knee-jerk questions get dealt with so they can focus on the other better distilled information.

I told myself: Hey, why not give this logic-stuff a chance?\nI tried to apply making sense into my current life, starting very softly: My behaviour towards the people around me. I started questioning everything I was thinking, saying and feeling. The feedback was pretty good. I was actually starting to feel better myself, by just being the best version of me possible, even if this includes me being in a disadvantage or whatever. Then I questioned my main problems: Depression, Alcohol, Pot, Fastfood, Sugar and not doing any kind of sports.\n\nBy JUST questioning and trying to figure out where the cause of my suffering comes from, I cured my Depression within 1 day. I laughed out loud.\nAnd the funny thing is, I even knew it deep inside me in the first place, but I just accepted being in this state because I thought thats how it is. Till now I couldnt even tell my environment about my disease, I kept it a secret. Thats why drinking alcohol helped me escaping from the reality and since it was actually accepted in society, I didnt have a hard time hiding my drinking behaviour. Pretty sad actually....\nBeing addicted to Alcohol and lately more Marihuana, I questioned why I have the need to do it. I solved the Issue with alcohol pretty fast, because its just full of shit if you're honest to yourself. Good think I wasn't fully into it. I am 22years old btw.\n\nBut I think Marihuana has a bigger influence to your consciousness and thats why I even managed doing logical stuff, allthough being high. It even pushed me. \nFirst I had to realize that SMOKING and BEING HIGH are two different things, at least it was for me. Because I also was a smoker, i was used to the habit of smoking.\nSo i quit smoking instantaneously when I realized that what I was doing was just a sub-consciousness habit my mind has. It doesn't know that smoking harms me.\nThe feeling of being high, was highly connected to watching movies, playing games or whatever bullshit. So nothing someone cant get rid of.\n\nTill now I did not deal with how drugs can change your brain or whatever, but I think Marihuana helped me understand the universal feeling of having logic as a core value, allthough I wouldnt recommend doing this. Its just what happened to me.\n\nAll in all my entire view on the world changed instantly after quitting these things and just living in the now.\nI started on 18.11.2016 on first hearing from the Click.\nI couldnt imagine solving the main problems of my life in just about 1 month, without any kind of medicaments or professional therapy.\n\nThese are just the things which I got rid of. There already were somethings in my life which already made sense.\nThey got so much improved that I am still fascinated by myself, or rather by the potential of a human being, which I am.\n\nI hope this helps in some way, there are alot of people suffering from Depression and being addicted to drugs or whatever.\nMaybe someone can relate to my heavy change and understand his own causes.\n\nSorry for bad ingilishy\nHave a nice day\nLevo\n\n\n","createdAt":1482959977,"score":12,"author":"Zitronelol","id":"5ksp3g"},{"title":"The only and most important insight you will ever need to click","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5kputn/the_only_and_most_important_insight_you_will_ever/","selftext":"Hey guys, Fabio from the crew here, I rearranged the new insight in a way that might be easier to absorb. \n\nExperience – what you are; existence; feedback loop; consciousness; a tool to align with consistency. \n\nFeedback loop – input and output through the senses; mechanism that has the ability to rewire the brain.\n\nConsistency – consistent patterns that bring about reality; reality itself; logic; life; the goal.\n\nThe awareness is that you are the experience that consistency (life) uses as a tool to become more consistent within itself. \n\nDefinitions will be used interchangeably.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThroughout evolution, life started generating a feedback loop that was ensuring more survival than the lack of it. \n\nWe can compare a feedback loop to listening to an orchestra. When one person is misplaying, it is much easier to figure something is off by listening to the music rather than by checking one musician after the other. \n\nThis feedback loop was so efficient through natural selection that it became the focal point of the organism. Experience has almost complete control over the brain. If you want to kill yourself, you can, for example.\n\nSo, this feedback loop (our experience) is merely a tool that life created to allow life itself to evolve more optimally. Experience is thus a mean to the end and the end is evolving as an organism. \n\nBut there is a problem: the consistent patterns that emerge in order to bring life have evolved in such a way that the consistency (logic; life) became the tool and experience became the goal.\n\nBut as we kept evolving even more, the feedback loop became so advanced that it started questioning its own existence, likely initiating the Cognitive Revolution 70,000 years ago, and bringing about exponential growth. People began to group themselves to try to find meaning (through religions, for example). \n\nToday, we reached a point where we understand the brain and the consistency that brought it about. We can realize that experience is not a goal but instead a tool that has almost entire control due to evolutionary reasons. We realize that the true essence (or the goal) is the consistency rather than the experience. \n\nLife (or the consistency) truly trusts the experience, even though experience itself started navigating reality in a very dysfunctional way, creating a feedback loop of identity and stories to strengthen the illusion. It is a completely dysfunctional cacophony because of a lack of understanding of what we are. \n\nStill, we are in control. Experience has the ability to rewire memories, thoughts, everything. We gained a lot of power not because experience was important but rather because it has worked throughout evolution. \n\nBy understanding that the essence of what we are, existence itself, is just a tool and the consistency is the goal, we change our paradigm. \n\nIt is not consistency that is a mean to existence. It is the other way around. Existence is a mean for consistency. \n\nThe purpose of experience is merely to serve as a tool for consistency to become more consistent within itself. Existence (experience) is the tool, logic (consistency) is the goal.\n\nAgain, the purpose of experience is merely to serve as a tool for life to evolve more optimally. Experience is the tool, life is the goal.\n","createdAt":1482925442,"score":17,"author":"hateramos","id":"5kputn"},{"title":"My Clicking Testimony","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5koznb/my_clicking_testimony/","selftext":"Hello. My name is Brian (you may have seen me in the discord), I'm 20 years old, and I'm from the US. I clicked about 4 days ago. I didn't make this post immediately as I wanted to be able to provide my insights on step 4 as well, and I now feel that it is a good time. I may, however, edit it later if I find more step 4 related information that I find pertinent.\n\nI will structure my story by the steps:\n\nStep 1:\nI always thought myself to be a very logical person. I always loved logic, and used it to frame my beliefs about the world. I thought myself to be the most logical person I knew. Thusly, I skipped step 1.\n\nStep 2:\nThis step was what really got me fired up about this movement to begin with, what drove me to want to click. I had figured myself to be logical, however I realized that all of my actions and decisions in life were driven by mostly emotion - specifically, my emotional desire for comfort. This was always a huge source of confusion in my life - the duality between what I thought I should do and what I felt like doing. I was using my logic as a tool to provide for my comfort. I was deluding myself the whole time, thinking I was a logical person, when in reality I was just as emotional a person as anyone else at a fundamental level.\n\nStep 3:\nThis step took me about 5 days. For the visualization, one needs to recall memories of their past where they can see that comfort had brought about their misery and suffering. This was difficult for me, as I had suppressed my emotions and my emotional memories most of my life.\n\nThe step 3 guided meditation, and the yo-yo technique, were both instrumental in getting me through this step. I dug deep down to find the memories of my past where I had suffered the most, relived those moments emotionally, and connected all that I was feeling to my core value of comfort. Then, I associated all the good things in my life, all the greatest moments and accomplishments, with logic. I did this many times, each time seeming to incrementally progress me through to the finish line. Every day, I questioned whether I had clicked yet or not, as I was behaving more logically. However, when I did finally click, all my doubts were dispelled.\n\nWhen I clicked:\nI felt a rush of euphoria, which lasted about 24 hours. Instantly, I had an instatiable hunger to logically restructure my life. Everything I thought about, I questioned. Everything I did, I questioned. I wondered whether I was brushing my teeth correctly or often enough. I wondered whether the cereal bars I ate for breakfast every morning were actually healthy for me. I wondered why the hell I ever drank Coca Cola.\n\nAnother thing that consumed me, was an intense desire to spread the movement. This has become my primary directive. My whole life, I used to care about nothing but video games. Whatever game I was playing at whatever time in my life, was the most important thing to me. I haven't played games since I began trying to click, and now I'm not interested in them at all. They are meaningless to me. All I care about is spreading this movement. Every action I take is in regard to how to most effectively accomplish this goal.\n\nStep 4:\nStep 4 is where I am now. It's the most difficult step by far for me, but now that I have clicked, I am equipped to handle it. I have a deep emotional drive to understand everything logically - consciousness, nature, my kitchen faucet. I see logical patterns in everything. I have adopted probabalistic thinking instead of binary thinking, to help me navigate this matrix of logical consistency. I used to have terrible anxiety, but it is all gone now, because I know that any problem I have, I can solve it with logic. And indeed, I have.\n\nI now experience minimal dissonance, largely because of the probabalistic framework. If I understand the probabilities of a situation, and account for the chance of \"failure\" beforehand, then there is no dissonance when the \"failure\" comes. I now think of everything probabalistically, and it seems absolutely vital that this probabalistic framework is adopted by all clickers.\n\n\nI hope my story will help others make their way through the steps. If you have ANY questions, or want any advice or etc, please feel free to DM me on discord or reply to this post.","createdAt":1482909249,"score":7,"author":"SurtrDotU","id":"5koznb"},{"title":"Clicked and didn't even notice it!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5kmyqf/clicked_and_didnt_even_notice_it/","selftext":"I'll be broad but concise. 27 years old, no job, delaying my graduation in Manufacturing Engineering since 2011!\nBefore i went through clicking and knowing athene i spent efforts in self development...  \nI wanted to be liked, so i learned how to be social.\nI wanted to get girls or a girlfriend, learned about seduction.\nI wanted to be aways right and correct, so i aimed to be great at hiding ANY flaws and make sure people knew the best of me.\nI thought that was the recepie to a great life! I would achieve all my objectives, have a great woman and a nice career.\nThe problem was, no matter how many girls i banged with i never made to an actual relationship that was healthy for more than a week. That used to piss me so much! Even further... When i was about to finish my college i \"froze in time\" there and went all the way to my confort bubble play games and just head out if i had something like a birthday party or a booty call.\nThe reason i messed up my study life and had the longest time without an actual job was because i was sorry for myself for never making one part of my dream... The relationship. With time i got only even more obsessed with it and my emotions were jumping from loving one ex to another. I tried shrinks multiple times and it never really worked. Then i tried some oriental medical assistance and it helped me a bit but not enough.\nMy idea of being happy seemed so impossible, my goals seemed meaningless in a sad way... So i utterly gave up in goals at all!\nHope you relate to my old self so you know you can find that THERE IS a way out of this cave.\n\nFound Athene's clicking movement through [Glinks video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWq1VNk6T2g) that appeared as recommended to me for some reason. It didn't intrigued me, i was basicly on the \"haha cult leader weirdo\" framework at first, but because he was speaking seriously and Glink was laughing and joking around AND having a hard time understanding what Athene was saying i kind of gave Athene some credit there. Returned to my old life for days, up to the point my memory made me think of this cult thing and i checked Athene stream (12/20/2016). I don't remember what was the content, but i got curious to the click thing and searched for it on the logicnation wiki and entered the discord. Started reading the wiki, watched [athene's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drcseH-7hpw) then the documentary, then some testimonies on the website and i was convinced there was something there, even though i couldn't see it, but the reward it said it provided was too appealing not to want to try it, so i started going at it to implement it!\n\n* (12/21/2016) Heard the first podcast, read about emotional inteligence, talked to 2 clickers on discord.\n* (12/22/2016) Talked with Athene on stream, heard second and third podcast, watched [this](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xv1j0n_the-secret-life-of-chaos_shortfilms).\n\n* (12/23/2016) Read step 1, heard fourth podcast... note: i wasn't playing games or i was playing without really wanting to play them (hearthstone, shadowverse) while i was reading something related to clicking.\n\n* (12/24/2016) did the guided meditation to step 1. At the end of the meditation, thinking on logic, i automaticaly thought of my loved ones and cried! I felt a surge of fulfilment in that moment, it was my click! I didn't notice though, because it was so subtle and i had some inner worries, especialy with the thought of 2 more steps to go. My thoughts were what hold me. Later that day in christmas eve i had a blast with my relatives and everybody was drinking beer or champagne or soda and i usualy join them, but i went straight to the kitchen grab me a cup of water and that was just... Automatic! I wasn't seeing a reason for me to not drink water, it is the best for me afterall. At the end of the night at around 2 am i drank some soda out of curiosity and the taste was the same as aways... It's good, but it wasn't as fulfilling as drinking water! And there was **no pride** in the process.\n\n* (12/25/2016) Lunch with the other part of my family. There was my mother and her boyfriend, someone i hated with a passion because he threatened me years ago of framing me and put me in jail (lawyer). I felt nothing close to that hate that day, and i assure you it was not the christmas spirit! I hugged him, same as i hugged everyone and it felt just as good as any hug. My urge to talk about clicking was enormous but i didn't... I kind of pretend i was just the same old me there with nothing new to but with a smile and good vibes. At a moment i sat besides a girl, the cousing of my cousings not blood related to me, and we started talking about whattever things... Suddenly she tackles about life goals and how hard it is to reach them, i get excited and say i'm looking at this philosophy of re-wireing the brain to have full control and eat water instead of soda because it's what we are ment to drink for thirst and similar \"wise\" things... She gets it and agrees (on a superficial level) and i take this as a note to self: \"gain trust so later i can pass the click for her\". At the end of the party i tell goodbye to everyone and to her i say it was an amazing conversation (validation) and i would add her on facebook. I do it as soon as i get home and it's amazing how i never for once thought about passing the click on to, for example, my best friend at the time. I was riding logic even without noticing. note: If any of you think sexual energy/tension was my driving factor i assure you it was not. I aways looked for a monogamy life and she was engaged.\n\n* (12/26/2016) I do steps 2 and 3 with the guided meditation. My core value was feeling safety. I worked towards people and things being at my favor so i was feeling safe, guaranteed. And confort was my way of escaping my failures in doing so. I tried visualizing athene or my father as my logic figures, but my own face was the most fitting, smile with confidence. Later that night i listened to the last [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/athenepodcast/aproval-seeking-vs-validation-seeking-podcast-61).\n* (12/27/2016) I read [this testimony](https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5kggsy/my_experience_on_emotionally_accepting/) and it made me realize i was thinking binary on some levels. Thinking that once i click i would be *safe* that the new state would fix everything, just like i chased everything in life (work or doesnt work). I realized i had clicked some time ago and i wasn't allowing myself to grow as a clicker, doubting the process because i didn't feel 1 big indicator. I exercised today in my own apartment doing pushups, abs and squats.\n\nIf you guys ever feel stuck on clicking because you feel pressured to click, to improve, to have results or pressured with the idea of making a difference to others or to giving it your maximum efforts... Don't be! Everything will happen at your own time! Because your own time won't be like before (playing a match on a game to relax before going back to work). Taking your own time will be you doing what you can in a logical way to get the logical result! And lastly, remember that turning yourself into logical is not to take every piece of life into consideration like \"will i start cleaning my arms or my legs at the shower? what is more efficient?\" That is something i used to think because logic was my tool, so i didn't understand it to it's fulliest!

Initially when I was introduced to the probability stuff I saw it as a huge upgrade to my logic and was hyped. Some guys from the crew were able to emotionally adopt it right away and told me how important it was.\n\nI had many conversations about it and tried different things like meditation, looking up quantum physics and listening to the stream but somehow I could never make it relatable. Every time I tried, I felt like I was hitting a wall or something was holding me back. I started to feel dissonance and questioned my emotional connection to logic because I was unable to do it. At one point, this resulted in me thinking that I might have unclicked. \n\nThe reason for my dissonance and my inability to adopt it was that I still had identity. Without knowing it, I had the identity of a person that is clicked. I wanted to fit in that certain profile in my head that told me how a clicked person has to act or feel.\n\nDue to my binary thinking I was always looking for evidence that would give me certainty on whether I am actually clicked or not. Whenever I was behaving accordingly to my idea of a clicker, I was at ease. But if I did something or thought something that I labeled as not logical, then I experienced dissonance and sometimes anxiety. I saw it as black or white.\n\nI went home for christmas and reflected on these things during the train ride. I came to the realisation that thinking about it binary didn't make any sense. I will never have 100% certainty on whether I am clicked or not. There will always be something that points towards it and something that points away from it. By thinking binary I am just setting myself up to suffer. I have to look at it for what it is and accept that there will always be a probability but never a certainty. \n\nFurthermore, the whole concept of identity is flawed.You aren't your identity, since it depends completely on where and when you grow up and what shaps you. Identity it just an imaginary constuct in your head. It is not part of reality. It is just an illusion that you want to make yourself believe in. \n\nRight after I had this realisation a young mother and her baby got on the train. I looked at the baby and realsised that the only difference between me and the baby are some probabilities. If I have had diffenrent RNG, I could have been that baby and lived its life. Literally the only difeerence between me and other people are just probabilaties. We are all subject to probabilaties and therefore there is nothing special or individualistic about me.\n\nAt this moment I emotionally accepted that everything is probabilistic.\n\n\nI hope this can help some of you guys to relate to it.

Maybe for some people it will work but atleast for me I have to do a lot of more meditating while visualising a lot of other scenarios so if you identify with what I say don't stress it and don't do step 3 destructivly like I did if you can't handle it but take your time and write down things if it helps and build up your visualsation process slowly. \nThis is something I haven't heard Athene talk about a lot but which Darnock which wrote a good guide about clicking discussed about a bit which I didn't emphazise enough until now. \nI want to mention this because for me it's a relief that you can get away from the stress and the harm of step 3 by reversing the visualsation process if it does more harm than good like it did to me and therefor you can get out of it. \nAtleast it worked for me and I think it sounds logical that it should work for other people as well which has had the same problem with negative side effects when doing step 3 while visualising it in a simular manner. \n\nI've have stomach pains and a lot of stress for more than 2 weeks but just today while really reversing the visualsation process of me being responsible for the holoucaust ect ect and when I say me I mean my core value the stress just faded away after a little while and it was a nice relief.

I thought he was hilarious and it was always clear to me that he was trolling and any sense of hating him for his ego was absolutely ridiculous to me because, well, he actually was the best Paladin. So, I just saw his act as a fun way to embrace being the best without actually being egotistical because that's exactly what the emphasis of his trolling was against. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if his ego was actually inflated he wouldn't have gone about trolling in the way that he did. I saw that and that's where my trust in this character called Athene began.\n\nWhen the crew came out with iPower and were focusing on net neutrality issues I was instantly reaffirmed that Athene is truly a humble person because it was evident to me, just so obvious, that his goals are controversy = views = money = Athene's means to actually change the world for better.\n\nl'll digress here to mention that I feel like this was a very important part of why I was so easily able to remain clicked after making the click. The likelihood that Athene is trolling about this clicking experience is actually pretty high considering that trolling for controversy was his platform, his means to actually change the world. When I reasoned this to myself after clicking, there were only 2 probable situations I could come up with in which this could be something that goes against my expectations:\n\na) I go to join the movement, find out I am absolutely rekt shrekt trolled. But now that I'm here and trolled, certainly Athene would have a beautiful, world-changing reason to have trolled me to get there in the first place EVEN if it has nothing to do with clicking. Ironically though, if that were to happened I still feel like I would continue to live my life clicked.\n\nb) I get completely and utterly trolled, buy into all this for a bit and basically it's a massive ploy to get a bunch of grunts to work for ATHENEWINS. I know I would eventually wake up from this reality and just learn from the experience of being taken advantage of. So, the way I saw it was, there’s no way this experience CANNOT help me grow as a person and achieve what I’ve always fundamentally wanted to do which is change the world.\n\nMoving on to my actual journey through the 4 steps:\n\nStep 1) I’ve always had a certain alignment with logic and problem solving. This made me very easily susceptible to Step 1. Essentially what happened here was that my whole life, I was very much intrigued by science and math but it wasn’t until I learned about Double and Triple integrals in my university physics classes where I actually started seeing the world in a different way. Almost as if reality is just a visual representation generated from the language of the universe that is always talking to us and just never shuts up. This spoke to me in a beautiful way. From this point forward, I adopted “The Most Astounding Fact” by Neil deGrasse as my world view. I would go onto using that world view as a more effective way to achieve validation or comfort.\n\nStep 2) this step definitely came after a long time of assuming the lifestyle of Step 4 without ever knowing about the click movement although it was only 4 days ago that I discovered my true core-value was validation.\n\nTo explain: I had fallen out of following Athene for the past 2-3 years and I hadn’t really known what was going on with the crew. I decided to go find out this summer and I came across the video “Most Important Video I've Ever Made. (this will change your life)”. When I saw this video it actually did change my life drastically. I had realized that I had been living my life to please my parents and brother, and more importantly, how much of an influence I can have on my behaviors that are a direct consequence of childish emotions being triggered. I took this as a wake-up call to live my life very similarly to how we do in Step 4, except that this was all flawed because only recently did I realize what my true core-value was.\n\nI didn’t continue watching videos about Athene’s movement nor did I learn of the development of the 4 steps because my girlfriend had promised me that she wanted to join me on this journey of self-improvement after watching “Most Important Video I've Ever Made. (this will change your life)” herself. This never happened and I kind of halted improving my situation in hopes that I could pick it back up when she was ready to join my experience so that we could share this.\n\nAs you can see this was all wrong. I was previously going about it in a way as if my core-value was family. What happened after was that my true core-value of validation slowly shifted to a mix of validation and comfort because I was actually just using logic as a tool to make myself happy. Things were going well. I quit my job, stopped looking for more 9-5s, and started making money using the skills I currently have, and so on. All this was doing was reinforcing my true core-value of validation as I now needed to feel validated by the opinions that I and my girlfriend still held in order to feel comfortable.\n\nIt was 4 days ago when I was listening to Athene on stream and he said something that hit me like a brick-wall. It was something along the lines of “depression is the result of the reward centre no longer being rewarded”. It was at this moment where my clicking experience actually began. It was my first time tuning into all of the “Athene Cult” controversy, which was right after watching a video from Glinks where he didn’t seem to understand anything about where Athene is coming from. I realized all I had ever truly cared about was validation. As soon as I perceived that my family and friends completely stopped caring about what I was up to, I fell into a deep depression that led me to dropping out of a practically finished undergrad degree in Physics and essentially turned me immobile for 3 years afterwards. I picked up terrible habits like drug and alcohol abuse. I didn’t have my family and friends surrounding me and constantly validating my “abilities” anymore. I just completely hid away from everything.\n\nStep 3) Right after I heard that piece of insight from Athene I got really excited but skeptical about this whole movement. I tried to look on Youtube for sources of debunking his way of thinking but I was just completely unsatisfied by everything I watched. Unable to convince myself that this was a hoax, I actually had some concerns about my perspective on life and how I was going about it, and so I decided to call into Athene’s livestream. I had a nearly 40 minute conversation with him on stream regarding questions that haunted me almost every day. These questions that haunted me were undoubtedly the sources of my anxieties, which you can clearly hear in my voice as I attempted to talk about these issues. I realized some things about the way I act and think about other people that were essentially holding me back, especially after re-watching the vod about 5 times. \n\nAfter coming to terms with the insights Athene had just given me, I took this as my opportunity to actually attempt to apply the 4 steps and catch up on all the content I had missed since “Most Important Video I've Ever Made. (this will change your life)”. Later that night I caught up to the “Science Find God?” documentary and it became very clear to me that the reason I had been failing so badly at actually adopting Step 4 as a lifestyle is because I had no imagery to cling onto when doubting or reinforcing my faith in logic. Furthermore, whenever my faith in logic was weak, my brother took these opportunities to reinforce ideas of deities or other comforting mumbo-jumbo.\n\nThat night, as I was trying to fall asleep, I was going through all the major events in my life in my head and it was overwhelmingly easy to see how logic was the main source of guidance for me and going against it or attempting to gain validation always brought me pain. Before I dozed off I remembered an idea that was very special to me when I was a child. That idea was: The same way in which I logically guide and mobilize Gordon Freeman in HL1, is the same way in which logical decisions should guide and mobilize me. When I woke up the next morning a version of that idea was instantly attached to a god-like presence and it seems impossible for me to describe the beautiful images I associate with this god now but it’s there and it feels closer than anything. In an almost indoctrinated way, but completely on my own terms, I felt that I was now a vessel by which logic travels through. I had clicked.\n\nStep 4) At this point I would say I actually didn’t know I clicked but I think it was because, not only was my path to this moment completely non-linear, but for the two hours that I was awake alone in my apartment that morning, everything I did or felt was seamless. Too seamless to even recognize how naturally occurring my day was, zero dissonance. The rush of endorphin came after my girlfriend woke up and we had a conversation.  The dissonance that I would usually be met with when trying to develop an idea around her completely vanished and in less than an hour I feel like we had the most productive conversation about the state of our relationship that we’ve ever had. All resentments seemed to dissolve. She then had to go the grocery store and I was basically sitting there in awe, completely relieved in a way I’ve never felt before. It kept building up from there to a point where it just was too overwhelming. I was sweating, laughing and crying in joy at the same. I had to reach out, I wanted to share what was going on, I reached out to Noxtep and kind of just emotionally typed at him: \n\n\"ninospvp-Yesterday at 2:03 PM\n\nI've been struggling with my relationship with my girlfriend for almost 3 years now and as soon as I talked to her when she woke up this morning, it's impossible to describe but the conversation we had, but we almost instantly sorted out any and all grudges we can hold against each other and I feel like she finally looked at me the same way again but in an ironic way, i don't yearn for it anymore\n\nit's not even like i was even expecting to talk to her this way when she woke up too lol\n\nNoxtep-Yesterday at 2:04 PM\n\nThat sounds great.

I've done so much to try to understand myself, I've used meditation and I introspected every key moments in my life. From the divorce of my parents when I was 4, I realized that my whole life I have tried to fit in because I wanted so much to be loved. Ultimately leading to be disapointed by other people's behavior, because they could never offer what I was truly seeking. \n\nBeing consistently disappointed and emotionnaly hurt by people, I adapted. Over the years I've built a fortress whose goal was to protect me from getting hurt by people. I've consistently rejected people that cared about me, losing my friendships., never getting too close to people, just keeping things as simple as possible on an emotional level. I submitted to this fear and the more isolated I would be, the safer I would feel. As a result, I would not see any close friends for months.\n\nThis  layer of my personality only got me so far as the consequence of it led me further and further apart from who I desired to be. All of my actions were guided by this subsconscious fear, preventing me from achieving anything meaningful.\n\nI experienced massive anxiety that manifested physically when I realized my life was the opposite of who I wanted to be. At that time I didnt understand what was happening to me, I was suddenly flooded by emotions that clouded my judgment and my view on the world. The fortress my subconscious built was not a viable solution anymore for my safety and I was consciously feeling and fearing that the remaining of my life would be an overwhelming amount of anxiety. I even started to wonder if a life like that was worth to live.\n\nI looked to seek the cause of all this, through introspection I managed to find it and within the next months I changed everything I hated about my life. I got a GF, I got my own appartment, I renewed relationships with my older friends. I did more in a few months than I did on my entire life. However I felt like I had to constantly fight myself again and again. I always had to go against this wall of comfort.\n\nUltimately I reverted to my old habits, to privacy and comfort, to solitude and monotony. The monotony provided me happiness as long as I respected it.  The loop was sleep, work and playing video games, everything was safe in this loop and under control. Nothing could hurt me.\n\nUntil I had a great job offer as well as I tried to join a charity. I unexpectedly experienced anxiety and I did not understand why or how. I almost declined the job for no logical reason, I back pedaled on the charity. I was flooded by sudden anxiety and conflicting emotions without knowing what was the cause of all this.\n\nNow I understand I never fixed the real issue which is this want to fit in, to be loved and accepted. I realize clearly that all these different events that define my identity have a complete random nature.  I dont have to get attached to these events as they happened in a probabilistic way, they dont define who I am in this very moment. I can let go of my baggage.\n\nLogic is so much better than my current core value which has proven to be so disfunctional in my life. I've suffered so much. I see now that Logic can provide a better solution to problems and is safer. By embracing Logic, I have a better understanding of who I am and the world i'm evolving in. I can see the extreme beauty that lies in nature and its mathematical complexity. I understand we all come from the same atoms that gave birth to the universe and that we all are connected and in a way the same.

Furthermore, I believe to have found the girl I’m going to marry about half a year ago, post-click I still believe this to be highly likely and very beneficial. \n  \nStep one was interesting to me, as I’ve never had any trouble following extremely strict self-imposed rules if I think they’re argumentatively water-proof. However, an emotional connection to this adherence to logic has always been missing, until I actively tried to make it, for example by watching Cosmos or by looking at my Master’s courses in a different light. Look up cellular automata models, if you’re interested. All in all, this went smoothly for me. \n\nStep two was more difficult, as I wasn’t sure whether my core value was comfort or fitting in, for different reasons. While looking into this, I heard Athene say several times that both these core values boil down to the same thing, but that didn’t actually help me emotionally understand what my core value was. \nWhat did help me, was trying to meditate on those moments between productivity, where I just kind of stared off into the middle distance, or browse dank memes and watch HS videos, just to stare at something. While I never did label this state of being with a world, I could ‘feel’ it and therefore understand it, which I believe is the important part. I started connecting the worst thoughts I could think of to that state: I’m rotting away, I’m not exercising my brain and body enough like this, I’m wasting away my life and with it, the lives of all the people I could have saved by not valuing this state. \n\nAfter that, step three was surprisingly easy for me. After thinking rationally about the click for a way too long time, doing research in stuff like Kierkegaard’s leap of faith and how I should do it, I finally caught on to the fact that this was just me hiding behind over-preparing instead of just focusing to change my neural pathways. Then, I did the third guided meditation once, after which I felt a short dopamine rush, which I assumed was the fabled click. \nOne big misconception I had was that the click was a binary event – like a switch being pulled in your brain. Of course, everything being probabilistic, I think I was totally wrong in this. For me, the click was only a small shift in belief, where I now emotionally want to do the most logical thing. Of course, I was sceptical and scrutinised my every action in search for a placebo click. Interestingly though, I realised I didn’t care whether I clicked or not, I only hoped it would have a big impact on the world.\nI’m still in step four, which I feel is extremely important, but I would definitely say there’s a strong before and after, even though there is a spectrum, obviously. Also, I’m in the process of helping some of my friends click, I’m expecting one of them to work it out within the week. \n\nFor now I will keep it at this, if you want to know anything, please feel free to ask!\n","createdAt":1482500458,"score":8,"author":"LuteusRex","id":"5jx4tb"},{"title":"How would a 'clicker' logically deal with the need for validation from here on?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5jvwjt/how_would_a_clicker_logically_deal_with_the_need/","selftext":"After one clicks I'm aware that some remnants of ones core values may remain.

Sometimes, I wouldn't feel any conflict in my mind but I knew that something was not right. I spent a lot of hours writing about my emotional urges, my subconscious thoughts, and my logical decisions, just trying to make sense of everything. I knew dissonance was normal but several times, I reached a point where I would feel an emotional pull to go back to my previous core value (or to something that would alleviate the conflict in my mind). Those were the situations where my distrust in logic would reach a climax and I am almost sure that I would have unclicked if I wasn't here in this environment filled with logic. \n\nWhen I look back, I realize that I started developing a strong emotional attachment to my identity as a logical person. That was the only way I found to keep my trust in logic and to deal with my binary thinking. I wasn't aware of this and I would spend a lot of time trying to reach conclusions about myself, obsessing about remnants of the past, unwelcome thoughts, and emotions that would drive me to act illogically. I couldn't find a solution to the problem using my logical thinking and the way I coped with it was by building up an identity around logic to keep the momentum going. \n\nWhen Athene talked on the stream 3 days ago, the insights about \"thinking probabilistic\" resonated a lot with me and I could see the importance of it. I immediately realized it would help me insanely because I was thinking about everything in a binary way. \"These emotions and thoughts are not good, this action is wrong, I am not a logical person, that idea is flawed.\" I never looked at it as probabilities but I knew the moment I would adopt it, I would stop overthinking and obsessing with my past (or even putting expectations on myself to find the right and optimal solutions to end the duality). \n\nBut I was having a hard time accepting on an emotional level that everything is fundamentally probabilistic. There was something blocking me. I could understand everything on a rational level, I understood that would benefit me a lot but I just couldn't accept it. I couldn't accept I might not exist, for example. I tried some ways of going about it but I was reaching the conclusion that my strong attachments to my identity were the real issue. I knew it was all a story I created but the attachments were deeply carved in me.\n\nSo, after trying different stuff, the way I start detaching was by writing down everything that was a probability in my life. I even imagined an empty box and I would just throw probabilities inside the box. This is what I wrote:\n\n\"I am a combination of probabilities. My parents meeting each other, the century I was born, my birth date, the country, my gender, my name, the way I talk, my friends, my brothers, my failures, my successes, my emotions, my attachments... I am just a bunch of percentages inside a box.\"\n\nI started feeling very vulnerable as I removed all the meaning from my life. I was merely a box with probabilities on the inside. I was just a percentage. At this point, I was stroke with the realization that I am no different than a kid in Africa. Only the probabilities are different. There is literally no difference, I could be in his place right now. \n\nAs I went deeper and deeper, I zoomed in in the percentage that I am. On a microscopic level, my atoms pop in and out of existence all the time, they are fundamentally probabilistic as well. As I looked at everything around me, I realized there is no difference between me and table. A table is also a percentage (his design, color, country it was built) and that table is also fundamentally probabilistic on a microscopic level. I felt a level of connectivity with the table as I had no attachment to my identity and I realized that in essence, me and the table are just a percentage popping in and out of existence. But if that's true for me and a table, then it is true for everything. Reality is fundamentally probabilistic which means that there is a combination of probabilities where reality might not exist. But if reality might not exist, I might not exist. And at this moment, I just felt something crazy went in my brain, the acceptance that I might not exist. I just couldn't accept it before but without identity and emotional attachments in the way, I just accepted it as part of my reality.\n\nI know that this was only possible because I already had a very strong trust in logic and my inner child was already looking for a way to improve the flawed logic he had put all the trust in. I wasn't comfortable, I was dealing with a lot of dissonance, a feeling of unease day in, day out, so the moment I became vulnerable again and the attachments to my identity weren't in my way, I instantly accepted that everything in reality is a probability, even my own existence.\n\nI think this insight might help people in dealing with all the dissonance from step 4. It is truly important. Also, for people that are trying to click, this might be a really useful way to detach from the identity and complete step 2, since there wouldn't even be a need to find your core value. Emotionally,  I felt really threatened as I labeled all the meaning in my life as a simple percentage (which is what is in reality) and I had to be honest with myself in this process but it proved fundamental to accept the insight on an emotional level.

Too fast, since I was convinced that I am already an extremely logical person that valued logic a damn lot.\n\nI was using the guided meditations, which presented me with some very visual experiences that were so vivid that it reminded me of the effects of psychedelic drugs. I really felt like I was floating in another dimension that consisted solely of emotions and thoughts. The interesting thing is, when I tried to imagine my inner child with a teddybear that represented comfort and warmth I wasn't able to convince my inner child to let go of the teddybear, because the teddybear... oh wow, I'm just now realizing this as I am typing... Okay, so: My inner child wouldn't let go of the teddybear, because the thought of taking away it's teddybear made me extremely, extremely sad. I now, while typing realized that this is because of childhood trauma that included said teddybear. (Feels like my mind was hiding this from myself until RIGHT now?) Another thing I can work on. Good. \n\nBut back to topic: I was able to convince my inner child to let one hand go of the teddybear. Then a character apeared, a tall, strong knight, a character I had once created myself for a book I was writing. I have a strong, positive emotional connection to said character, so I felt at ease, I felt perfectly safe with him being there. The strange thing was he looked different than I had created him, kind of... futuristic, and the colors blue and green where very vivid details sorrounding it. It was perfectly clear to me, that he now represented logic. And strong and trustworthy as he was, he also meant safety. Logic ment safety. He reached out his hand, and my inner child took it with great relieve.\n\nAt this moment, when my inner child closed it's fingers around the fingers of the knight that represented the strength and saftey of logic I felt a sudden blissful feeling, a rush through my whole body. I really underestimated this. I would have NEVER expected to feel it that physical.\n\nI woke up very suddenly from my meditation and felt very refreshed, light and ...just calm and satisfied. I knew my direction. I knew what I had to do. The following days were extremely productive, without being exhausting. I didn't need discipline, and doing what made sense was actually satisfying. Everything seemed to be as it was described when making the click. Also, I was thinking a LOT and experienced a LOT of dissonance, but different than before I was happy about the dissonance, because it ment I found something I can fix.\n\n\n---------------------\nPART 2\n\n..So the more and more I thought about my life, making sense, logic, the future of this organism that is \"me\", the more I started to feel anxious and hesistant, because I kept stumbling over the same doubts and the same topics again and again, which made it clear to me that I did not click. Not completely. \n\nOne of the biggest questions I kept stumbling over was: How does having a relationship fit into all of this? How does it make sense? And sex, how does sex fit into making sense? It causes a lot of anxiety for me when I try to think about that, because I can't find a satisfying and logical answer, aside from reproduction. \n\nHow is it logically beneficial for the \"superorganism mankind\" that \"I\" find a partner? I think, due to various reasons, I have a strong desire to love and be loved. But love has to make sense. And at the moment, with my current amount of knowledge, it doesn't. And it drives me crazy.

With that, this testimony is about how I thought I “clicked”, discussed it live and on stream, then “actually clicking” roughly a month(plus some weeks)later.\n\nOn Tuesday, October27th, 2016 I woke up, I “clicked”. I instantly opened up Twitch on my phone with this fresh idea and volunteered to Skype Athene on his stream about my, about my “clicking” experience. (For the sake of understanding, and getting to the point I will shorten it a bit, there is a VOD, I have already given you the date you can listen if you want details.) I spoke briefly through my troubles (pre-click), and through reaching each step, and how logic came to me after waking up that very morning. It was a wonderful experience, I got to talk to my childhood hero and I even tweeted about it right after! (Sound familiar post-clickers?) After the discussion I believed to be making logical decisions throughout my day-to-day life. (I actually do believe some of them were; please comment if specifics needed.) Was I attaching those decisions to my, newly restructured, reward center to logic? The answer, shortly put, is “No”. \n\nIt is now Monday, December 12, 2016 and I have “actually clicked”. It happened after a nice steamy bathroom and warm shower, I was relaxed, then I was sudden. In the month and (roughly) two weeks between these two events. I believe I have been stuck, in a weird limbo, between Step 3 and Step 4. (This can be quite intense and sometimes horrifying; I do not recommend moving to Step 3 without first knowing 1, and 2, are very concrete and embedded in your thought processes.)  I was being torn apart by my attachment to comfort and social validation by intermingling those core values with the core value of logic. This caused me great dissonance and threw me into an autopilot making incorrect decisions and being very illogical. When I realized all of this and “actually clicked”, things got very different very quickly. My best example: as I was processing thoughts and ideas, I could also feel myself drawing these thoughts and ideas out in my mind; I could even feel it in a physical sense. Everything started to “click” and connect together. I can definitely say an abundant amount of neural pathways were forged today. \n\n “But Jim, you might ask, do you still have attachments to Athene, the Crew, the movements, his content, and his channel?” My answer now is yes, but a different kind of attachment. One that is not for my validation and comfort around those I seek approval, but for the logical reasons behind why him, the Crew, the movements, the content, and his channel are so important. There is such a disconnect today and we have discovered the answer. My advice for those taking the initial leap and starting to trust in logic, is not only to reach out, but to reach in. Find what truly drives you and put it in a duel against logic. If you do this enough, eventually Step 3 will come about almost naturally. It is Step 4 that is a key component after the click happens. We are all tested to make logical decisions every day. Remember the duel technique back from Step 2? Use it at Step 4 again, and the logic will always prevail. \n\nPlease feel free to leave any comments, ask any questions, I am here to help!\n\n~Grimchief (Jim)\n","createdAt":1481597861,"score":5,"author":"Grimchief","id":"5i15it"},{"title":"What are the limits of entertainment?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5hyzke/what_are_the_limits_of_entertainment/","selftext":"I don't think I have clicked, but logic has helped me through tough times over the years, I had thought a lot about these topics before, and for almost every decision I took, I knew what was the most logic thing to do, but my inner child wouldn't let me do it every time.  \n\nEvery time I procrastinated or played games instead of working or studying, there was a fight inside my head between right and wrong and most of the time, the wrong would win.  \n\nClicking is about overcoming the inner child with ease, but what is the value of entertainment, comfort and having fun after you clicked?\nDo you have control of how much is too much?  \n\nPlaying 3 hours of video games to help me relax and be with friends is logical?  \n\nBinge watching a tv show is logical if I don't constraint my diet, physical health, work, etc?\n\n\n","createdAt":1481574298,"score":3,"author":"mariojsnunes","id":"5hyzke"},{"title":"I think I have clicked (or close to)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5ht968/i_think_i_have_clicked_or_close_to/","selftext":"I've realized what I truly am from an objective reality standpoint for quite some time now.\n\nIt is only recently where I started to truly apply a lot more logic and sense to things I do everyday.

English isn’t my native Tongue, so I hope you take it easy on me when you encounter weird Formulations and Grammar. \n\nBefore I go into detail about the Click, I should explain what kind of Persona I am.\nI grew up in a conservative Environment with a religious (Christian) background, although me and my Family never gave much about it really, and we put our backs on this religious Ideology pretty early on. Why this is important for my Story I will explain later on.\n\nI was a Grade A+ Student in Math in School, but this knowledge never got promoted, and i kinda fell thru the Grid, because i sucked at other subjects like Biology, Sports, Religion and English. My skills in Math devolved over the Years, but i developed other Skills in Philosophy, Psychology (Emotional Intelligence) and i really love Art, specially the one on the Skin...\nI always valued Logic, but everything i've experienced each day went against it, so i began to Rebel pretty early on in my Life. I evolved a Mindset that went diametrical against a pure Logical Mindset because i saw each day how delusional and crazy the World is...i mean, you just need to open a Newspaper and the Crazy laughs in your Face. So how can Logic be useful, if everything we experience each day goes diametrical against it?\n\nIf Athene proclaims he is the Messiah, i was pretty much his Negative my entire Life.\nI stole, betrayed, lied, persuade other people to bolster my own selfish and egoistic agenda. My emotional core grew into something really nasty based on profitting from others like a parasite, because why should you move your own arse, if other people provide, right? It did make sence to me (based on flawed logic) at that time.\n\nI've wasted my Teenage to early 20s taking pretty much every drug on the planet, but i was always smart enouth to find the Exit, because i've learned everything those “Tools” had to offer. However, at the end of my drug career i was confronted with the first depressive phase of my life which went on for about a year, because i overdid it plenty of time seeking altered states of consciousness, and i often went pretty much to the limit my body could handle. I was always a “All-In of bust” personality with everything i did in life.\n\nDrugs didnt gave me happiness, so what did i do next?\nI dived deep into the Working World...had 2-3 Jobs at the same time, earned a shitload of Money...and it was never enouth to fulfill my need for Luxury and Comfort. I've burned out in 2007 which resulted in the second depressive phase of my life. I've realized that it doesnt matter how fast or how good you run in the hampserwheel, it will never be good enouth. I didnt take another Job until now...almost 10 Years without Work.\n\nWork didn't fulfill me, either...so whats next?\nAt the turn of the Century i've tried Love...found this wonderful Girl in Ft.Lauderdale / Florida, and even went over there (permanently) to marry her. The whole thing lasted 2 Years and then it broke apart due to my own selfish laziness and the lack of Cash. I even got her pregnant and got scared at the Thought of having an own Child in this mad World, so i convinced her to get rid of it. For her this was a pretty big deal, because she was a die-hard Christian...most Americans are. Abortion is a major Sin according to the Bible, however she did it (as far as i know...but there is also a real possibility that i am a daddy, and i dont even know it).\n\nFor the last 16 Years i've carried that Thought around...having killed my very own baby which could be very well into Teenage Years now. This sparked a third depressive phase (a subconcious one, overlapping with the one i had due to Work) i didnt knew about it until the Click and everything that followed. You see, from a Christian Point of View i violated every Single one of the 10 Commandments including Murder...so i must be the Antichrist right? (more on this Topic later)\n\nSo what did i do the last 10 Years without Work...sitting Isolated in my small Appartment living at the existence minimum, without any real Friends and just my Family to support me?\n\nI became very humble, and i went Deep looking for answers why everything in this (my) life is literally Shit. Early October 2013 i discovered a Major Piece of the Puzzle by myself...my own Emotional Core. However, i couldnt really make Sense of it at that time.\n\nI remember i was watching Videos on Youtube i.e. The Greatest Speech of all Times by Charly Chaplin, or the Girl that silenced the World for 6 Minutes. This shook my Emotional Core which was partly based on Comfort for the first Time in my Life so massivly, that i was crying for a entire Hour...it basicly ripped my Heart appart in my Chest. At this Point i kinda had an epiphany, a Heureka Moment...basicly a Flash of Light in my Mind, and it was a feeling like God himself touched me and opened the Blueprint of the Galaxy right in Front of my Nose.\n\nThis entire Event forced me to write (i never wrote a line in my live, let alone read a book), and it took place for 10 straight days...writing all day from 9am – 9 pm, sleeping...eating very little and writing more. It was a feeling like i was the new Messiah gaining new deep Religious insights brought to me by God himself. I even tried to gain a Following...tried to convince my Neighbour about this new Knowledge. I even tried to convert 2 young Guys (Jehovah's Witnesses) visiting me at that time. It was pretty hilarious, my Neighbour thinks to this day that i  am a complete whacko, he doesnt talk to me at all anymore. Looking at the Data i wrote down back in the days (having a new Emotional Core based on Logic) i can only laugh really. Pretty deluded Stuff. I guess my Comfort Core (the little child) was trying to make sense of it using a Religious Framework. At the end of the 10 days i was becoming very Paranoid, seeing the Snake from the Story of Genesis behind each Corner whispering Lies in my Ears. And then everything snapped back to Normal. It went away from one day to the next, but you dont really forget something like this.\n\nBasicly from October 2013 to November 2016 i was trying to make Sense of what happened there, and i was looking everywhere. I was trying to reproduce the Event using Meditation and Binaural Beats, because the Event was quite wonderful to be honest... I even tried Hypnosis and went to the lengh of taking DMT which is the Main Substance in the Mystical Brew called “Ayahuasca”.\n\nAnd then in Nov.2016 something happened, and everything spiraled out of Control.\nI found this Video on Youtube called “Logic Nation”, and when i watched it i thought:\nHey, you know that Stuff he is talking about (from Oct.2013).... so i kept watching it on a Loop, trying to understand it... WANTING to understand it...and then the Grenade went off in my Brain. Full blown Psychosis. My inner Child went on a complete Rampage... pretty much like Nolan in your final Documentary but 100 times worst than that.\n\nI was literally laying on the Ground in my Appartment, crying, sobbing....and begging God for relieve, because i couldnt handle it....today i know it was the little child in my head trying to rationalize what was going on, and it was clinging to EVERYTHING...from pharaos to aliens to whatever. I was even posting funny Comments here about Santa Clause, and i thought it was totally logical. I was constantly shut down by Concasser which further angered my inner child (the Ignorance in my Head), and it went expotentially worst after that.\n\n\nOn the next Day my Sister figured out that something wasnt quite right with me, and she indroduced me to her psychiatrist who diagnosed a Psychosis, and i was put into a mental Ward for 5 Weeks. On the first day...i didnt want to stay. My inner Child was shouting at me: Why do this puny Humans do that to you, you are Superious...rip the Door out of the Wall and leave. Didnt really work out that well...they put me in a Bed, fixated me...and put drugs in my veins to calm me down^^\n\nHow i've managed to overcome this Madness you ask?\nBest way to describe it is with the little Angel and Devil sitting on your Shoulder, telling you shit.\nI've painted my Inner Child the devil, and Logic (i've trusted Athene on this one) the Angel.\n\nI was clinging to Logic with everything i've got for every Single Second, and damn...that Inner Child was the biggest Arsehole i've ever encountered in my entire Life (Freud would love this statement for real)...but i can with a certainty say...he is gone now...for good. And i never want to meet that Arsehole again :)\n\nFunny thing is... during this Time i've kinda lost track of time, and my Ego basicly vanished.\nIt was a constant talk in my Head Devil vs Angel, and the Angel (Logic) finally won 2 days ago.\nI know today that it wasnt a Psychosis at all...it was a Catharsis and it took almost 6 Weeks in my case. I guess thats because i am a relative old guy, and i got more Shit in my Brain stored over the Years.\n\nI see Things very clearly and sharp now, draw conclusions almost instantly.\n\nWhat changed since the Click?\n\nI quit smoking.\nI've lost around 20kg in 6 Weeks, changed my Diaet...not fully vegan, but much more plantbased...and i eat a lot less... got less appetite. I live in a Family based House, and we got social eating here...\nI challange my old habbits on a daily base now, get more easily out of my comfort zone\nI've became a lot easier to talk to, understand Emotions on a fundamental level.\nI constantly see the circle of influence around me, and think what i can do to help.\nI've started posting OWN philosophical Insights using my own Thoughtprocess and Brain kinda like : Doubt is the Curse of the Free Will...or: Repentance is the result of social resonance.\nI enjoy Music and Art even MORE since the Click...when i listen to good Music, it feels like a self introduced MDMA Trip in my Brain (if you know the feeling). Check out “R_Evolution” from Guillem Mari..its a pretty decent Poster for your (our) Movement, dont you think? :)  http://thirdmonk.net/high-culture/psychedelic-watercolor-paintings-guillem-mari-art.html\nI kinda feel like running out of the House and changing / hugging the World.

What lead me to that believe was, that I was vegan and didn't believe in god, I always valued facts and science very highly. But I completly ignored the facts that I wasn't logical during my day to day life. For example, on some days I would go out to party and get drunk and have unprotected sex with women I have met that night (danger STDs etc). I actually went into Athene's chat with the believe that I clicked and told him about it (validation seeking, below is more context). I promptly got banned from chat, which caused confusion in my mind. I asked him in skype why he believed that I didn't click. I still have his message in my mind \"ego issues\". Days after that sykpe message I was thinking about what he meant with it. Do I have ego isseus? Am I ego driven? Am I really that shallow? A few more weeks passed after this without anything changing. \n\nI was always aware of the four step program to make the click, but I never really thought about it, about how to apply it.

I don't think I have to recap the four steps, but I bascially realized that valdiation seeking is my mindset. I spent a lot of time in the gym. I was really honest to myself and came to the conclusion that only do that to impress other people, to get validated by them (you look shanked etc). Why do I hook up with strangers, to get validation that I'm good looking. It's an endless spiral, it was my core value. But not anymore.

I thought I might share some insights for people who feel the same since my first post didn't went into much detail.\n\nThe first thing is to figure out why you are attached to it in the first place. You might say that you play an instrument because you like it and it's fun, but that's only half of the story. For example, if you are invested in playing guitar it's not because you like plugging some strings that are connected to a piece of wood but because of the emotion you connect to it. Maybe it makes you feel safe, valuable, gives you confidence or makes you feel superior in comparison to others.\n\nThere is always an emotional reason why you resort to music. The main reason why it may seem difficult to let go is because your inner child is holding to it. If you for example base your self esteem on being a good musician that people look up to, it easily becomes your identity. Your inner child wants to protect it since this concept makes it feel safe. Being aware of this is highly important to understand yourself and making the click.\n\nThe way I was able to click was by first admitting that I have low self-esteem and that I tried to patch it up by having an identity of being a good musician. In situations where I wanted to be confident, I just remembered a performance and how people were applauding which gave me a temporary confidence boost.\n\nIt made me feel kinda sad because I realised I will never truly fixed myself and only got brief self-esteem from my environment. There were always a lot of times when I still felt insecure or low self worth. This identity was just not cutting it for me anymore. \n\nI felt how my inner child got upset because it somehow outplayed itself by holding on to something that didn't work. Then I told my inner child that with valuing logic I would always be confident and I wouldn’t need to base it on a certain activity. I wouldn’t need to do something that was giving me value merely through the eyes of others. I can be confident for my own sake. It's all gonna be fine.\n\nAt this point I was able to gently let go of my emotional attachment.\n\nLooking back I would say this was maybe the most difficult process I had to go through while trying to click. I can't emphasize enough that you really have to be honest to yourself and ask why you are doing it in the first place.\nWhen you finally see your core and understand what drove you the whole time, then you will have a much easier time letting go of attachments. After you go through this process you will realise that logic can give you whatever you have been trying to achieve the whole time.\n\nIf you have any questions or something to add feel free to comment.","createdAt":1481393595,"score":9,"author":"FlawlessTT","id":"5hlf4g"},{"title":"If you feel like you don't have emotions WRITE YOUR LIFE DOWN!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5hhwlk/if_you_feel_like_you_dont_have_emotions_write/","selftext":"Hello!\n\nI'm in the process of pursuing the click and even though I know Athene has talked about this topic on RealTalk and on stream I really have to say what maybe isn't so obvious which i found out to pursue step 2 is to WRITE DOWN MY LIFE(I'm still working on it, but I'm done for tonight)\nWhat I found from my own experince is that it's super essential to write your life down in a word document or a paper to get everything down because if your core value if it isn't logic what your core value will try to in order to protect itself is to inhibit your thoughts and make it difficult for you to acess them. It will force you to think about something else which releases dopamine and it will cause dissonance when you try to acess your emotions so what you have to do is to WRITE YOUR LIFE DOWN!

It just seemed so obvious, but still I had never really applied it to my life.\nIt was something close to \"yo-yo\" technique I saw someone mention, but I was mostly only focusing about the bad things comfort is responsible for my life, and then kept \"shocking\" myself with the realisation how it could all be fixed by logic.\nI did not experince an immediate mental \"shift\" or something, I did however feel differently, suprisingly it was physical for me. Perheps I had just entered a state of meditation for a moment or something but I felt different, relaxed or something like that. I'm not sure how to explain it, but it was something.\n\nWas it a click? Or some kind of pseudo-click? I really don't know but whatever it was/or wasn't It has been changing my life. ( at least so far, ~30 hours later)\nAfter all this I simply woke up and started exercising. No obvious reason as to why, just did, it felt good do be doing something. I didn't stop thinking about logic there tho, just kept thinking and thinking, imagining how my life is going to get better by following logic etc.\nYesterday was full of just \"running\" around for me pretty much after that. Cleaning the house, doing stuff that had to be done, and always thinking. \"Is this how its gonna be? Can i keep this up etc etc\". Probably overthinking a lot at this point.\nAnyways, what I also did yesterday is quit smoking. I wasnt the biggest smokers of all but still a solid 3-pack-a-week smoker for 3-4 years. And I just stopped. Just like that. I mean its not like I'm a retard, I always knew how illogical and stupid it was to smoke, but I still kept doing it. And now I just fking stopped. Just like that. Same with weed. I was used to smoking weed at night before going to bed and watching series  or something. It felt like absolutely pointless thing to do yesterday/tonight. Both, weed and series.\n\nI don't know what this is, if its temporary or here to stay, but whatever it is i'm liking it and not letting it go. At least today I've managed to hold it the whole day, while still actively thinking about logic tho, and repeating in my head how it will make my life better. Last night I didnt sleep good ( maybe it was because my body was used to weed every night ) now it's 1:10 AM and I'm still not sleepy, but head is racing with thoughts, its like I could \"feel\" my brain activity.\n\nSure I've forgot to mention everything, and sorry for bad formating/mistakes I've been writing in a rush kind of.\n\n//Oh yeah the nose twitch haha, forgot that. After the \"click\" or \"pseudo-click\" or whatever it was, I started to have a weird twitching of nose. It's not even noticeble but yeh its been doing it. I read it can often be triggered by big stress/excitement and since the latter is what I've been feeling for the past 30 hours it kind of makes sense, will pass probably.

I've put together all the information I could find that is relevant for people who are less in touch with their emotions. I expect this is relevant to quite some people. If you have any feedback or extra (useful) information, please let me know as this can potentially help many people.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Guide for emotional intelligence\n*****\n\n###Intro\nAs clicking is an emotional process, training yourself to become more skilled at noticing and working with your emotions is something that will always help. No matter which step you are stuck on, understanding your personal emotional dynamics will help you get past obstacles. This skill will also help you with step 4, as your emotions don’t disappear after you click. (reddit.com/5fsbl4)  Even if you are already quite knowledgeable about yourself on the rational level, refining your emotional self-awareness will still help you. This is especially true if you have been trying to click for a while.\n\nIf you feel you are stuck, figuring out the obstacles that are holding you back is the best thing you can do in this situation. You should always keep in mind that there is a reason why you haven’t clicked, and usually it’s quite a small obstacle. Trying the same thing over and over without direction won’t get you anywhere, I learned this the hard way myself.\nSince many of these obstacles are personal to you, it’s important that you can help yourself. Talking to other people on discord and reading the subreddit can certainly help, but is useless if you don’t think for yourself.\nApplying the advice given here will help you become better at recognizing and working with emotions and emotional frameworks.  Just reading this guide won’t make you click, it is merely an (important) tool for you to analyze and take control of your situation.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###For who?\n\nMany people, especially guys, grow up being told that showing emotions is bad/not cool. The environment might reinforce from a very young age this with things like “guys shouldn’t cry, be a man” or “don’t be such a pussy”. Many of these kids build up a strong habit of pushing away (suppressing) emotions whenever they come up. When these people grow older, they might believe that they don’t experience the emotions, that they make decisions purely rational. This is because the habit of suppressing is so deeply ingrained that it comes natural and is completely outside of their awareness.\nIf you are in a similar situation you will probably have a harder time making the click, as the entire process is an emotional one. Many people might read the 4 steps and misunderstand what is meant, because you are thinking about things rationally rather than emotionally. However, even if you have been pushing away your emotion for your entire life, given some time and dedication, you can figure yourself out and make the click quite easily.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n###Support for learning (and clicking)\n\nThe following tips will help you in your journey to understanding yourself. Even though these habits might feel like a chore, you should frame it as an opportunity to see how you react emotionally, without giving in to the temptations.\n\nIn order of importance:\n\n•\tDaily rhythmic breathing (2’) and mindfulness meditation (10-15’)\n&gt; This is the big one. If you want to click, it is very helpful to be able to go into a meditative state where you merely observe the emotions and thoughts that come up, without judging them or labeling them.\n(rhythmic breathing: youtube.com/watch?v=DUbAHGPtNM4 )\n\n•\tHealthy eating (decreasing refined sugar, increasing fruits &amp; veggies), exercise, and a consistent sleep schedule\n&gt;These are very useful to reduce the noise in your head, which will help in noticing subtler emotional dynamics.\n\n•\tTaking notes\n&gt; Will help immensely in noticing whether you are making progress or just running in circles. Writing insights down is also important, as reading your own notes will help get a more objective look on things.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n###The right mindset\n\nNeuroscience tells us that we experience emotions even before we become aware of them. Since we can’t (successfully) stop these emotions from coming up, it makes little sense to beat yourself up for them. \nDealing with emotions in the most effective way requires a specific approach that is quite similar to what is taught in meditation. In the meditative state of mind, you become an observer of your own mind. This self-awareness is like taking a step back, to get a better perspective. Taking distance from the stream of thoughts is a very important skill that helps in making the click, this will become clear later on.\n\nBe aware that no matter how hard you try, random things will still appear into your mind. You should simply acknowledge the thought/emotion, accept that is it part of you, and then let it go again. Trying to prevent thoughts from popping up is futile as it will only result in more thinking. If you do notice yourself trying to push away thoughts, there is no need to beat yourself up over it. \nBe careful not to fall into the trap of “thinking about not thinking”, almost all beginners have this at one point or another.\nThis state of mind is easiest to train using guided meditation. Don’t worry, you don’t need to sit in uncomfortable positions, nor believe any mystical things.\n\n- soundcloud.com/athenepodcast (guided meditations)\n- www.youtube.com/watch?v=64ZU2UCQdmQ \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce you understand the basics, you can begin using mindset in everyday life. Observe yourself while you are working, during casual conversations, while eating, commuting to work, etc.\nTraining this state of mind daily will help tremendously in applying the insights described below.\nIt's also important to consider how you frame the whole process of clicking. If you just “want to click” because it’s a cool thing to do or because it gives you something you want, you have much lower chances of making it. There must be a genuine desire to figure yourself out emotionally, you need to really believe your current core value doesn’t work.\n\nFurthermore, you should check yourself for expectations that might be hindering your progress. Try to foster a mindset where you see everything as a new opportunity, without taking your past as a burden.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###Accepting emotions\n\nNeuroscience has clearly shown that humans are fundamentally emotional beings. A large part of our brain is dedicated to regulating our emotions. These emotions are the driving factor behind what you do in everyday life, the things you like and dislike. \nSince our emotions are in control on the deepest level, it’s important that you first fully grasp that your rational part is not making the decisions. The emotional core uses the thinking part of the brain to get what it wants. Even though you might feel a lot of control, any time your emotional core goes against your reason, the emotions will win.\n\nIf you think you don’t experience many emotions, it’s very likely you are pushing them away so you don’t feel them. The same thing applies with memories that were emotional before but seem dull now.\nSome examples of methods people use to avoid feeling their emotions:\n\n- Pretending something hasn’t happened\n- Overeating &amp; eating foods loaded with sugar and fat\n- Seeking entertainment whenever you feel bad (TV, YouTube, Facebook, games, …)\n- (Excessive) use of alcohol/other drugs\n- Always keeping busy so you can’t feel (even productive things!)\n\n\nYou should start your journey by being very honest to yourself on these topics. Permit yourself to have these feelings, it’s OK for even the toughest guy in the world to have feelings. You don’t have to beat yourself up because of your past. You can start fresh as soon as you commit to changing yourself. \n\nIt is important that you fully accept your emotions as they come before anything else. You must FEEL that it’s ok to have feelings. You should FEEL that you can be honest to yourself. If you can’t be honest with yourself, how can you expect other people to be honest with you? Take some time to reflect on how this applies to you before moving on. \n\nBe careful though, accepting your emotions is not the same as blindly giving in to any impulsive desire that comes up. You should simply see the emotion, acknowledge &amp; accept its presence, and then decide the best course of action. Although acknowledging &amp; accepting might seem like a trivial step, it is essential if you want to leverage your emotions effectively.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n###Recognizing emotions\n\nOnce you’ve fully accepted your emotional part, it’s time to start spotting/recognizing it. The steps below are sorted to create a smooth learning curve. Don’t rush the process by skipping steps, this will only slow down your progress and make things harder.\n\nFor starters, you should try to identify the strongest emotion you experience in everyday life. The stronger the emotion, the easier it is to examine, as you won’t be able to fully suppress it.\nExamples of easily recognizable emotions are: stress from work or studying, craving for comfort food, anger towards certain things in your past, cravings for entertainment, etc. If you lead a very comfortable life and have no strong emotions present, you can induce them yourself.\nIf you have a hard time finding something, you can try to induce the emotion yourself. Example: you could stop eating comfort food, go on a calorie-restricting diet, while also exercising harder (please use common sense and do this responsibly).\nWithin a few hours to days, you will undeniably feel hungry and tired. You can use these strong emotions as your object of study, even if they are quite far from the click.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce you clearly have the emotion in your awareness, take the time to deeply examine yourself. Determine where you feel it, in your stomach, chest, throat. Maybe the feeling is stronger in some areas, try to become aware of that. Investigate how the sensations feel. Maybe it’s a slight burning sensation, maybe a stabbing/crushing feeling or maybe it’s a pleasant tingle. You can also observe how you overall state of mind changes, try to zoom out so you see the bigger picture. Maybe you mind becomes fuzzy or more random things pop into your head.\n\nYou should build up a detailed description of your experience in your mind, as if you are a scientist studying a new phenomenon. Using the meditative state of mind will help in getting a more objective look on things. Writing down your experience will help immensely, as reviewing afterwards allows you to gain a deeper understanding and build upon the progress you’ve already made.\n\nAs this is likely unexplored terrain for you, it’s important that you keep trying even if things don’t work out on the first try. Only repetition will tell whether or not your approach is the right one.\n\nBe careful not to drift off into the language part of your brain as you try to build up a picture. We are trying to connect to the emotional parts, mental chatter is simply a distraction. It’s important to recognize the distractions and deal with it in a calm manner, the meditative state. Then you can (gently) bring you attention back to the emotion and continue.\n\nAs you get better, you can start exploring subtler emotions. For example, during a conversation someone might use words that you find slightly offensive or the person might be slightly boring. Whatever it is, you use the moment as an opportunity to dig deeper into yourself. For myself, it was as if a whole new world opened. So many things that were ordinary before suddenly became interesting.\n\nIf you carry over this habit into your everyday life, you can connect to your emotions very quickly. It’s important that you view this as a learning process and that you try to figure things out, one step at a time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###“Riding the wave”\nIf you are quite disconnected from your emotions, it is tempting to just feel the (strong) emotion for a split second and then push it away again. Because you have the feeling in your memory, you can be tricked into believing you’re still experiencing it when you’re actually not.\n\nIf you pin down the emotion and keep feeling it for a longer time, the experience can change. It can be compared to a surfing. A surfer rides a wave by constantly changing direction so he stays on top. The moment he goes against the wave, he sinks. The same should happen with your awareness and the emotion that is present. Your awareness should rest on the emotion for as long as it lasts, no matter where the feeling tries to move or hide. \nIn the beginning this can be very daunting and you might feel like the emotions are too strong to ever face (especially fears). However, when you approach things with the right mindset and give it some times, you will build up the ability to face almost any emotion present (barring some extreme trauma’s). Once you have fully faced an emotion for the first time, it’s common to experience quite some relief afterwards. You can use this as an opportunity to strengthen your trust in logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Step 2 - Drilling to the Core\n\n(make sure you’ve done step 1 first, trusting logic)\n\nIf you are not so closely in touch with your emotions, you might believe you have already reached your emotional core (step 2) if you understand your core value rationally. This is not enough though, you also need to connect emotionally. If you attempt step 3 without connecting to the core, you can feel heavy dissonance for weeks on end without making much progress. Below are some tips on how to reach your core.\nOnce you can connect to the subtler emotions, you can start focusing on the emotional framework you build around situations. The reason you might feel good while doing something irresponsible is because you create physical or mental environments where you are comfortable. You create a story to explain and understand what you are doing, even if it goes against reality.\n\n##Consider the following example:\n\n&gt; “I went to chill with my friends on Sunday because I was really stressed and I want to maintain the relationship. Plus, in order to click, I have to be in a clear state of mind which is not possible when I’m stressed.”\n\nAlthough this story is plausible, much of the story is probably a lie so you can feel good about your impulsive decisions. A more realistic version would be:\n\n&gt;“I was feeling depressed and a friend messaged me, asking to go out. In an impulsive moment, I said I would join and offered to drive. After sending my message, I could see that it was a bad idea to go out tonight as I have to get up early tomorrow for work. I should make up an excuse so I don’t have to go or tell my friend the truth. I know there is clearly better ways of relaxing than going out and getting drunk.”\n\nThis is a very simple example, and you might deny doing this in your own life. If this is the case and you really can’t find anything where you are even slightly dishonest to yourself, you should talk to a good friend or relative and ask them to be bluntly honest. Explain some things you do in everyday life and ask them if they see holes in your explanation. I can guarantee you they will easily spot the grey areas you are abusing, as long as it doesn’t go against their own story.\n\n\n##Another example:\n\n&gt;You keep telling yourself “comfort is bad”, “comfort hurts me” etc. but you don’t feel any dissonance on matter how hard you try. Your inner child (emotions) might see it like this “I say these nasty things, but they don’t really apply to me. I’m saying these things because I want to click because it will make me feel better.” \n\nIn this scenario, you don’t fully believe what you are telling yourself, you are lying to yourself. \nYou will have layers that are specific to you, so it’s important to have keep an open mind and be on the lookout for things that feel slightly off. There are usually clues when you are lying to yourself. You can run some “experiments” in your mind to learn more. \nI noticed in myself that thinking about the click felt slightly different than thinking about everyday stuff. The way I overcame the barrier was by mentally denying/rejecting it. It was as if the inner child wanted to put big in my thoughts, and I denied it by pushing it aside.\n\nWhen you believe you’ve found something, it’s important to really dig deep and try to get through it for quite some time. The first time you try to remove a layer, it won’t come off. You will only see a change after many tries. \nOnce you remove all the layers, you should have quick and easy access to your core. For most people, their core will express itself as a very strong feeling of weakness. You might spontaneously start crying, feel your face cringe or feel like curling up into a ball. Responses might differ from person to person, but the emotional core is a very primal thing so you should expect primal emotions.\nIf you get to the core, you can start causing dissonance by visualizing. You put comfort in a negative visual, logic in a positive one, and you go back and forth between both (switching every 2mins)\n\nSome tricks you can consider to overcome resistance:\n\n- Eating less (comfort food)\n- Exhaustion (physical and/or mental)\n- Denying rewarding things (e.g. huge meals, validation, gaming, smoking &amp; other drugs)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Step 3\n\nThere were a few \"prerequisites\" that I did before making the click. As most of this has already been explained in detail elsewhere, I just put short bullet points.\n\n* (Easily) access your core\n* Rehearse your positive connection to logic (train your visualizing)\n* Rehearse your negative connection to comfort (train your visualizing)\n* Meditative state = clear mind, not identifying with thoughts\n* Yo-yo trick: 2min negative comfort, 2mins positive logic. Start off very gently, then gradually build up the amount of dissonance &amp; resonance.\n* Make sure you pin down the emotions (riding the wave)\n","createdAt":1481034336,"score":33,"author":"CrYofFuN","id":"5gt3js"},{"title":"I think i clicked","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5gnfk0/i_think_i_clicked/","selftext":"Hi,\n\nso initially i seemed to have automatically placebo clicked while watching athene's stream in late october. I felt excitement from this and a strong drive to do logical things but it did not feel completely real to me and i was skeptical - something felt off. I kept doing logical things which started with restructuring myself but I later realized that my actual core value (fitting in) seemed to be getting in the way a lot, so it faded. However, at the same time I was also feeling extreme dissonance which I suppressed due to a strong attachment to stacking money which was related to something i was doing for money at the time.\n\n\nSo fast forward a few weeks to mid november, I felt a bit sad that I did not take any action beyond restructuring my beliefs. I was in bed just letting my thoughts wonder and i felt a bit guilty as I knew comfort and fitting in values are a dead end. This was several days after realizing that my real value was fitting in which i patch up with comfort, and whilst i was lieing down i felt this sensation where there was a lot of pressure inside my ears. It was very brief, about a second or less, like a gush of strong wind. At the time I thought \"shit, i wanted to tie up loose ends that were making me feel dissonance before i clicked\" and I had the feeling that this was indeed a click. So i slept and I woke up feeling, once again, the increased mental clarity and drive to understand everything logically and do logical things. However, I think this was also a placebo click, because while I was wrapping up the things in my life responsible to me that were making me feel duality, I seemed to have unclicked yet again... friends got me to play games even though I didn't really enjoy it and I was still watching athenes stream for comfort. I told a few friends about the click however their elaborate rationalizations around it such as calling it a cult seemed to have swayed my view on an emotional level, which must be because I have an emotional connection to them, which I later find out is connected to a strong rooted emotion i had to getting rank 1 in WoW from years ago.\n\n\nFast forward a week or so: After experiencing placebo click twice (or click and unclick twice) I was a bit frustrated with myself for not taking any action, however I still felt this level of clarity and peace with myself but I knew there was duality buried deep as this must have been the defense mechanism of my inner child protecting its core value even more. I was in a constant meditative state. It felt nice, but i was angry that this also meant that it would be harder to click, and i felt almost hopeless in fact, to the point where I was almost going to give up and resort back to this sludgy comfort &amp; fitting in lifestyle. I kept telling to myself that i hated being a parasite even though I felt at peace.\n\n\nSo on 26th november, I decided to water fast &amp; meditate the entire day (deprive myself of all rewards). On that day I was only starting to scrape the surface of how i felt at the core. My inner child was protecting it strongly. However I realized i made a big mistake; I was *strongly* focused on clicking and this seemed to have made it even harder to click or access my deep seated emotions. The only things I seemed to have gained from doing this was that I discovered that I still had a strong emotion connected to getting rank 1 on wow even though I had not really played that game in years. Everyone that i had played a lot of arena on WoW with also was connected to that strong emotion. So basically validation. When this emotion bubbled up to the surface, I tried to flip this by imagining \"getting rank 1 as a superorganism\". But I did not click this night.\n\nFast forward to 3rd dec:\nI did the same thing again, water fasted &amp; meditated the entire day. As the experience began I was delving through strange defense mechanisms my brain had created to protect my core value. I was imagining clowns and weird entity's however I did not entertain these thoughts and they soon faded. This whole experience was quite a blur to me but as I got closer to my core I found myself experiencing resistance, and I found myself wanting to curl up into a fetus position and hugging myself around a radiator. I felt very scared and also immensely guilty. I was trying to visualize inside my head and imagine my core value as a rotting teddy bear and logic as a gold ball that engulfed my inner child giving him instant intrinsic confidence. Later on I told to my inner child that he can trust me. I told my inner child to please stop hiding, i was asking him why he was hiding and that he could trust me. This carried on for hours to the point where I felt i could not get any deeper. I then told my inner child that I was *sorry* which triggered this avalanche of emotions that released from my body and made me cry lots, more so than i had ever done in a long time. The following morning was accompanied by a strange lucid dream of a strong electric shock going through my ear.\n\n\nI don't think i clicked that night. But the following day i felt vulnerable and unsafe once again. Just like I felt before i placebo clicked in October. I felt really guilty and that I won't be able to click. I played games with friends for the entire day. I felt okay while i was playing them but when i turned off my pc and went to bed the vulnerable and unsafe feeling quickly came back. I was going over thoughts in my head that I would be stuck in this paradigm forever. I heard athene or someone mentioning that it may be easier to click when tired as you will think less in audio and more visual, so i let my visual thoughts continue even though i was tired and wanted to sleep. I felt scared in my flat on my own, and was imagining skeletons and scary entitys in my room while i was in bed and i also tried attaching a bad smell to my emotions, like the smell of a rotting bin. Nothing seemed to happen, however when i gave up and as I was lieing in bed and \"not really trying\", the pressuring sensation in my ear happened once again. It was weaker this time, but I was skeptical if I clicked and I was also very tired so i slept.\nWhen I woke up the next day I felt this restless sensation to get up and do logical things which i had not felt in years. Normally I would just continue to lay in bed until I could be bothered to get up as it was normally more enjoyable than most comfort-related things i would do. I came to the conclusion that i must have clicked last night and here i am writing what happened.","createdAt":1480961491,"score":7,"author":"braindeadly_","id":"5gnfk0"},{"title":"Can't imagine logic being safety for me","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5gnea4/cant_imagine_logic_being_safety_for_me/","selftext":"I've been trying to click for almost a month now.But my main problem is that i can't have an unconditional trust in logical because i can't relate to it.

Since I was about 13 I experienced low self-esteem and social anxiety as I had developed from puberty breast tissue under my nipples, similar to how girls develop breasts; a condition called gynocomastia. This was very traumatic for me. In my already critical years of puberty where one starts to care more about what others think and making sure one fits in, I felt very confused and scared. From this I always felt like I was never like all the other ''normal'' boys in a negative and inferior way. My gynocomastia even made me fear that I was turning into a girl. You can imagine all the fears that I developed from this and the constant anxiety of thinking if other people notice it and what they think of me. I had certain depressive periods where didn't want to go to school and at one point I was even suicidal (yes, at 13 years old). My core value from there on has always been getting the validation and safety from others to make sure that I fit in and so that I am not neglected or rejected. \n\nAs I was growing older, these emotional states did not benefit me in my growth and adaptation with reality. I had a hard time talking to people and especially girls. I felt like i couldn't be a man that my social conditioning has taught me, even though I always tried my hardest to. I therefore developed an identity/ego around this channeled through my passion for bodybuilding. The bodybuilding aspect helped a little bit, I was able to function better and feel a little better about myself as I became the biggest and strongest guy in my school at around the age of 16, but at a core level I still always felt worthless, unworthy and unlovable. \n\nAs I was going through life, certain things hit me harder emotionally than expected. My first girlfriend breaking up with me and getting together with one of my good friends really broke my self-esteem. I gave up on girls and thought it is all hopeless. I had a period where I said fuck everything and all I was caring about was lifting more weight in the gym to forget about everything. \n\nI was developing a resentment to girls and distrust in people. At around 18 certain events happened that made me feel extremely guilty and more shame over myself. I developed generalized anxiety that was bothering me everyday that then few months later escalated in to panic attacks. I had obsessive intrusive thoughts over if I was gay as I no longer felt excited about seeing or talking to girls and thoughts that I am worthless and I am going to hurt people. I then about 6 months ago had such a panic attack that fell into depersonalization, a state in which your rational and emotional part disconnects as the emotions are too strong to handle. This made me feel numb, as if I was viewing myself from a 3rd person perspective and I didnt feel like I was in my own body. This made me fear and distrust reality. I didn't know who I was anymore or who the people and the environment around me are. The emotions felt gone so reality felt fundamentally different. The depersonalization was reduced a little bit. I started fearing stuff like god and the devil, even though I have never been religious or believed in that. I experienced weird thoughts and emotions constantly hijacking me everyday. My joints and muscles were aching from all the anxiety and paranoia. \n\nI started going to a psychologist, researching psychology online, listening to the athene podcasts, read ''Real Answers'' and tuned into the streams. Although I did all this and understood the information, I couldn't apply it. My whole life I had never really thought and questioned things. I didn't consider myself smart, so I had all these doubts, plus the fears and intrusive thoughts and emotions. I felt like I couldn't trust the information, I felt confused and didn't know how to go about my life. Then I heard about the click. This was the answer to everything. When Athene said along the lines of, ''You can trust logic more than anything as everything has a reason. This reality is made of consistent logical patterns, it is just that you don't understand them yet, but trust in that everything has a reason, but you just don't understand it'' this gave me a lot of hope. I then learned more about the click and the 4 steps. \n\nFor step 1, what worked the best for me was what Athene said about ''everything has a reason, you just don't understand it yet'' as well as personifying logic into god. Even though I am not religious, the idea of someone or something out there taking care of me and looking over me really resonates with me emotionally. I know from Christianity that god loves everyone and all I have to do is love him back and all my problems can be solved. \n\nAs I went through step 2, I didn't know what my core value was I had too much dissonance to even ask that question or figure it out, so I went by it by logically understanding all my trauma, anxiety, dissonance, etc, that was there when I started analyzing I constantly pinged to how logic will take care of this. This is a very hard process and took me about 4 weeks. As dissonance was being reduced I came closer to understanding what my core value was. It is important to be very honest to yourself and feel the emotions. I understood then that it had something to do with people and what resonated was love, hugging, validation, being a part of a group. I then defined it more simply as validation. Also all the other ''positive'' things such as comfort, my bed and the validation of friends and family, I understood that without logic, I wouldn't have this, as well as seeing how logic brings more safety, happiness, comfort, validation, etc. I was constantly aware of everything in my experience and pinging it to logic, either how logic can solve this or how logic is better. \n\nStep 3 happened automatically as I was doing step 2 and as I have learned and understood, my reward center got connected to logic. I felt a dopamine rush and a present moment experience. I went to a lake close to where I live and just saw the patterns in everything. The pebbles on the ground, the ducks in the water, the waves and water ripples, the sun reflecting on the ground, even in how people were walking and talking. I understood that this is what beauty is, logical patterns. \n\nThough the experience was something I would describe as true beauty, it didn't last like this, and here is where the importance of step 4 can not be stress enough. My identity, past, intrusive thoughts, anxiety was gone. I was just in the moment, but as I was saying ''hi'' and smiling to strangers walking by, I could feel my social anxiety coming back (remnants of the past). This freaked me out a little and so I tried again to understand but it got worse and it felt like it was coming back. So I went back home and laid in my bed and repeated a similar process as in step 2 ''logic is safety, everything has a reason I just don't understand it. Logic is god.'' This I learned is very important. As I have experienced very strong negative emotions and traumatic experiences, going through the click won't instantly get rid of them, they will come back, but the benefit of the click is that I can now handle them and I am not afraid of taking my time on it. This is of course the most logical thing. Even if I have to lay in bed all day, finding ways to strengthen or maintain the emotional connection to logic is the most logical thing I can do. I had to accept that I hadn't been ''cured'' but that I have been given the tool that will gradually help me solve my problems. The euphoric experience can then sometimes come back and other times it is less as I have not fully understood all my dissonance nor strengthened the neural pathways for logic enough. This is ok, this is just a part of the process, but I know if I stick to it, things will just get better and better and my awareness will grow.\n\nMy tip for more emotionally sensitive both clickers and non-clickers with similar experiences like mine. If you feel that dissonance that is strong is coming back, accept it and go back to the concepts and emotions that strengthen your trust, safety and love for logic. When you feel safe enough, slowly and gradually go through your dissonance to understand it. If it gets too hard, go back to concepts that strengthen logic. In my case, if remnants of the past comes back and I am, for example, researching and learning, it is more logical to stop and try to figure out the dissonance first and also to think of those concepts or go experience those things that strengthen your love, safety and trust in logic. Another way to strengthen your emotional connection to logic is to try to manually reward yourself when you do logical things. I would even suggest to exaggerate your manual reward and connect it back to what ever concepts of logic that resonates with you. So for me it is the personification of logic as god and all the beauty in the patterns around me. This helped me strengthen the trust in logic to then help me in my process of understanding remnants of the past. \n\nI hope this post helps at least one person in some shape or form. :)\nCheers","createdAt":1480697771,"score":21,"author":"OscarOgge26","id":"5g4bez"},{"title":"Debunking Fear","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5g2yg4/debunking_fear/","selftext":"After my click a lot of fears and doupts came up that created strong dissonance. The only way to get rid of that dissonance is to understand where my fear is coming from. This insight helped me a lot to understand my fears, maybe it will help you as well.\n\nFear is just a mechanism to keep you alive it´s the foundation of ervery living being to protect itself from death. A rabbit without fear will die, because there will be no drive to run away from a wolf e.g..\nSo why do you feel fear, even if there is absolutly no life-threatening danger anywhere? There has to be something that feels in danger and wants to protect it´s life.\n\nA conclusion would be, that when you were a baby you were very sensible and needed a lot of attention and warmth. Otherwise the baby would feel that it could be in danger and die, so it starts crying to get attention and increase the chance to survive. In the past there might be real a danger of dying without attention, because of cold weather, need of food, and wild animals. You were depandant from others to survive.\n\nSo when you did not get the attention that is needet (and most of us did not), you had to find a way to handle it. One way is to suppress these fears by rationlising them and just pretend there is no fear (you did not have the intelligence to find a logical solution). You started building a crutch by thinking `` I am strong and could survive on my own´´. And of course a lot of affort is needet to maintain that illusion, because it will colide with reality all the time. The illusion foms into an identitiy/ego that you need to protect, because you think it will give you safety. \n\nConcequences of being in constant fear of losing you identity/illusion:\n\n* anxiety around other people \n* depandant on validation and fitting in \n* low self-esteem\n* seeking for comfort\n\nAs you can see it absolutly makes no sense to hold on to that illusion because it will bring you even more fear. If you take your time to understand your fear you will see that it´s always the same pattern. In constant fear you are not able to do the progresses from dependency to autonomy, that is needet to be an independant healthy human beeing.\n\nDeep inside you might be still that wining baby full of fear. But with a deep trust in logic you can start building confidence and self-esteem, because logic will safe you, take your fear and give you the foundation that is required to grow.\n\n","createdAt":1480680951,"score":5,"author":"jonie196","id":"5g2yg4"},{"title":"Having fun as core value","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5g34jk/having_fun_as_core_value/","selftext":"Hi, \n\nI haven't really seen any subreddit regarding having fun as a core value so I thought you guys may help me make the click. Once and for all.\n\nI have been listening to the podcasts a couple of months now. But it wasn't until last night that I understood what my core value is. It's having fun. Having fun, caused by fear of not surviving/taking care of myself (financially). This core value makes me escape from reality and not think about these problems. I do have a job, but it has always been a problem more or less due to my mother while growing up. She hasn't really valued money and she pushed the problems away instead of dealing with them. I believe that this affected me growing up and I started to not value money. \n\nThis made me escape the financial problems by playing games, hang out with friends, partying hard, meeting too much girls and even occasionally take drugs. I have on the other hand been working out for almost 5 years now and I think that is my biggest \"lifesaver\". I would never stop going to the gym - no matter what. It's a passion of mine.\n\nNow I wonder how I can make the click while having fun as a core value. I really do have a lot of negative points on my core value and I do value and understand logic. But I can't really make the click. Or have I already? Because I do feel dissonance if do do something illogical. I just don't feel that happy or relieved. Would be great to be really happy without girls or ecstazy. I guess I have to fall in love with logic some way?\n\n\nThanks in advance \n\n/Dan\n","createdAt":1480683655,"score":3,"author":"Drax3l","id":"5g34jk"},{"title":"Athene's Debates are helping me.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5fy97r/athenes_debates_are_helping_me/","selftext":"Hi guys, as i am on my journey to achieving the click I think this video that i stumbled upon helps me more than anything to get there. \n\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/athenelive/v/103731190\nIt is Chiren debating with two individuals.

My Click journey started 1 month ago, first I will introduce myself to give you an impression of what kind of person I am/have been. Maybe some people can identify with it and get inspired.\n\nI was a very introverted guy over that last years, I had very low self-esteem, social anxiety and my life was just controled by fear of not being accepted and not being good enough. \nIn school I wanted to fit in and be a part of a the group of cool kids, but I always felt alone because I knew that my fear is bigger and I cant´t suppress it by pretending I am am cool, strong and confident.\nI started playing video games and felt realy comfotable with it, because in the game I had control over my life, I felt strong, confident and powerfull. So for the time I went to school my computer was my best friend. There is a high chance that my corevalue was a combination of fitting in and feeling comfortabe.\n\nMy life turned a bit when my ex-girlfriend cheated on me and I broke up with her after 1 1/2 years. I was so frustrated that I got interested in doing personal development and spirituality to build me up again. It realy helped me a lot and for 3 years that was my tool to build confidence and get a strong foundation so that I can help myself when shit is going down. I still had a lot of fear in me but know I could handle it and build an armor to protect me from getting hurt.\n\nBecause of personal development I started to structer my life more logical. I started working out, eating healthy(vegan diet) and build connections with like mindet people. Back in the days I already knew that I wont study, because if I am interested in something I can just learn it by myself and look it up in the internet.\n\nI already have been following Athene for some time and listened to his real talks and podcasts. But when I heard about that clicking stuff 4 weeks ago a fire started burning in me and I just wanted to click.\n\n**Step 1** \nAs I always said I already had a logical structured life and was very open to learn and improve to be a better version of myself. I watched almost every video/documentarie that is recommendet in step 1 and the [fractals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s65DSz78jW4) and [fibonacci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2wU-HT7FiM) stuff realy strengthened my trust in logic. I wrote down almost all my insights I got from it and I recommend you to do the same, here some examples that might help you:\n\n* If I want it or not, EVERYTHING just works because of logic\n* There is a logical answer behind everything I am doing, thinking and feeling, I already make sense\n* I am not a seperated identity, I am a purly logical beeing and logic wants to develop through me\n* Logic is my friend and if I trust in it I will find an answer to every question I have and will have\n* I can trust in logic because reality is logical \n(some more insights that will help you [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5am10y/detailed_post_about_my_click_took_2_weeks/))\n\n**The essential point in step 1 is to TRUST in logic**, you can compare it with god if it helps you. Imagin logic being an infinit source of knowledge and wisdom right infront of you wanting to guide you and give you safety. You can only trust something if it gives you safety. And what could give you more safety than understanding reality?\n\n**Step 2** \nThe most importand part in step 2 is to reflect on yourself and everything you are doing, feeling and thinking. In the first two days I felt like shit but I could reach my core. My inner child just wanted to have affection, love, being understood and validation because in the past that gave me safety. I realy could feel the pain and suffering inside me and where it comes from. Its importand to feel all you suffering and understand it, if you do, step 2 is completed. So feeling safe (comfortable) was my corevalue but its not that importand to have a name for that feeling.\nI also had a moment when I saw a picture of my father holding me when I was a baby. I started crying because I just had a strong desire to be hold like that again and feel safe and loved. I ,,transformed`` into my inner child and just gave its feelings space to just be. \n\n**Step 3**\nIf you did step 1 and 2, have an unconditional trust in logic and know whats going on with you inner child Clicking will be the most logical concequence. I tried doing step 3 realy hard for the first 2 weeks but I could not make the click. I contacted a Clicker to ask for advise and it helped me a lot. I already had a very emotional moment when I saw the picture of me and my father holding me and tried to convice my inner child that logic is better and will give me more safety but I could not do the complete switch even though I got realy close. I got a little bit frustrated and took a break of trying to make the Click. I went to the gym and suddenly I had an insight on why I am still holding on to the fear. When I went back home I wrote it down and something In my brain just crashed, I was like WTF am I doing that makes no sense, my fear makes no sense, my corevalue makes no sense I understood my corevalue deeply and could see it clearly. I already had a strong trust/connection to logic so I knew that I dont need that fear anymore and logic will hold me. I could feel and convice my inner child that this corevalue does not provide saftey but will bring more and more fear, so it could grap logic instead. My thoughts instantly stopped I felt a reliefe and was just in the moment happy and free. It felt so natural and easy to let this flawed concept go. Since that moment I had the following effects.\n\n* I struggled with asthma for 10 years and its almost gone now\n* I want to do logical stuff and it just flows naturaly\n* I feel like beeing high the hole day and have A LOT of energy and focus\n* I do not have the desire/need anymore to stick with an opinion (to feel safe)\n* I am okay with not knowing something, uncertainty is no longer a problem (because I know that if I trust logic the answer will be there at some point)\n* A deep desire to learn and grow\n* Verification is not that important anymore\n* I dont need to prove myself\n* I am in a relaxed state and I feel like the fight in me is getting less \n* need less sleep\nand a lot more...\n\nEven though I had these changes my doupts that I clicked were realy strong. I needet the validation that I did the Click and red a lot of testimonies to compare my experience with other peoples experience. The click was still very fresh and remnants of the past kept showing up, so I struggled a lot to keep the energy going.\nAt some point my doups destroyed me and I just unclicked. For two weeks I tryed to go deeper and hoped for a proper click experience so that I wont have any doupts, but of course there will alway be some doupts, the trick is to just not indentify with it. So I realised that everytime I think about logic how it will change my life and will help me to be a better version of myself I felt A LOT of energy and happiness. So I just dropped my doupts and trusted that posetive feeling again. \n\n**Step 4**\nWhat helped me a lot after the click is to think for myself before adopting an opinion of someone else. Its literally the first time in my life thinking for myself and without doing it doupts will destroy you and there will be a lot of them showing up after the click. I unclicked because of that and I think that it is the most important thing to keep your energy up and keep using logic. The real task starts when you click so its good to strengthen you trust in logic more and more, you also want to do it naturaly anyway but keep in mind that your brain has to rewire itself. Give yourself time and be patient, keep doing logical stuff and after some time it will be normal and your foundation will be strong. Move your ass and do some exercise it will help your brain to rewire and will free your mind of dissonance.\n\nSo yeah, It´s not that hard to Click but you realy have to want it your whole being hast to strive for it and after some time it will happen anyway, because it means that something in you is already connected to that idea. You dont have to learn to be logical but you have to discover it, its your nature and if you trust it it will guide you, it´s just a process of letting go flawed ideas an accepting your nature. Keep going and you life will change completly.\n\nThanks for reading and I will be happy to have some feedback and of course you can ask me questions.\n","createdAt":1480585598,"score":7,"author":"jonie196","id":"5fvrkc"},{"title":"What creates \"the consistent patterns that bring about our reality\"?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5fvnc3/what_creates_the_consistent_patterns_that_bring/","selftext":"Other way to put this; from where do those patterns emerge?","createdAt":1480583261,"score":4,"author":"betrion","id":"5fvnc3"},{"title":"For all the clickers on how to deal with anxiety","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5fsbl4/for_all_the_clickers_on_how_to_deal_with_anxiety/","selftext":"Hey guys, Fabio from crew here.\n\nI am going to add this to the \"guide for people that clicked\" but I am also reinforcing it here as some people have been reporting experiences of anxiety. \n\nIt is written in the guide that you will still have illogical thoughts and behavior correlated with your previous core value. The dissonance and anxiety that they bring are normal and they might put you in a bad mood and feel somewhat stressed.\n\nThe reason these emotions alter your state of mind is merely because you don't understand the reason they are there. If you don't take the time to sit down and wonder about the reasons, they generally pile up until a point where you are forced to do so. Having logic as a core value has that (good) downside. Dissonance doesn't vanish on its own, without an effort on our part to understand it. \n\nSometimes we are not aware that the dissonance is the cause of our grumpiness or anxiety. We know there is a problem, we know that something doesn't make sense but we can't quite understand what. And until we sit and either write or think deeply about what might be, negative emotions often start to become a big hassle. \n\nIt is also said in the guide that clickers shouldn't tackle strong emotional obstacles like traumas, at least, when the faith in logic in low.\n\nBut... if you have no other option, you are experiencing a lot of anxiety while dealing with certain events of your life , and you can't find a logical solution, remember that you have the support of the community. From what I've seen, clickers don't tend to rely on others to arrive at a solution, but in some cases it is the logical decision.\n\nYou should also remember that there is always a logical solution for every problem and sometimes, it is only a matter of time until you find it. Until then, you shouldn't beat yourself up as that is not the logical decision. Focus on gathering more knowledge and writing more about what you think might be the causes behind your emotions.\n\nAnd also, this is very important:\nStep 4 is not only about actively doing the right thing but also actively thinking about what it is the right thing. If you rarely think about what you are doing or you don't try to frequently understand the emotional reasons behind some illogical behavior, layers of dissonance will begin to pile up. Everytime I stopped actively scrutinizing myself, I ended up with some residues of anxiety that I wasn't even aware of. \n\nWriting everyday about my feelings and potential improvements clears my head and helps me to look at the things that I work on from a better perspective.","createdAt":1480541409,"score":13,"author":"hateramos","id":"5fsbl4"},{"title":"My click story","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5fq1qz/my_click_story/","selftext":"I’m 27 years old and from Denmark. 2016 has been a great year for me with a lot of victories. Such as a massive weight loss, and generally getting in good health. My clicking story begins 20th October the night \"logic nation\" video was released.  I watched with great interest, and after the video I checked out the subreddit. Even though it was mentioned in the video that \"comfort\" was a core value, I didn’t fully absorb it. It was when I saw it in writing on the subreddit that I instantaneously made sense of it. My whole life was pretty much explained just by the two words together \"comfort\" and \"core value\". Up until then I had thought that a core value could only be a positive thing, so I believed my core value was independency or something alike. But after realizing comfort was a core value. I pretty much replayed my whole life in my head, and I could pinpoint everything to comfort. From laziness, my lack of physical activity, my desire to play video games, and most important of all, my obesity and bad state of health. At this point I experienced an incredible euphoria for the next 3 days. I spent the next 4 days consumed watching documentaries. The 4th day I had to socially interact with people again, and I expected to be this \"enlightened\" being and nothing could harm me, I was however to be proven very wrong. In conversation with friends, I got hurt from very mundane and trivial things they said. After the conversation, I was very confused, as I was now aware that I must not have clicked. It was only a placebo click. \n\n**Step 1:**\nI reasoned that the reason I didn’t fully click was because my faith in logic was very low. I didn’t even get time to understand logic as defined by this community, because I instantly placebo clicked after reading that comfort was a core value. So, I spent the next 3 weeks or so reinforcing my belief in logic. I watched Cosmos, Documentaries about fractals, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, listening to realtalk podcast and several documentaries by BBC Jim Al-Khalili. I was absolutely convinced that this whole \"clicking\" thing was real, because even if it was a placebo click, I would not have been able to spent 4 days entirely productively before the placebo.\n\n**Step 2:**\nIt was very easy for me to find my core value as described earlier, however I had now believed that validation was also a core value of mine. I looked back at my life being a bright young child and always getting praised for my natural \"intelligence\". However, as I grew older, I obviously could not rely on natural intelligence only, and would have to study and put in effort, but at that time I was not ready for that. I expected to be able to pull through anything because I was \"smart\". When I realized, I was not as smart as I thought, I was already a late teen, and by that time I was already deeply consumed by my \"comfort\" and was doing nothing but play games all day. Thinking more and more about this, made me realize that the whole validation was because of comfort in the first place. My real core value was comfort, and validation was just my way of being \"comfortable\" in social situations.\n\n**Step 3:**\nAfter the placebo click, I was spending 3 weeks to reinforce my belief in logic. I realized after some time, that I had become happy in those 3 weeks. I was in a weird mixed mode of comfort/logic. Basically, I was still driven by comfort, but now my comfort allowed me to do logical things without me getting bored, or wanting to play games or anything of the likes. I realized this quite late, because at this point I truly felt happy with my life, being able to be productive, while still feeling rewarded from comfort. My comfort had convinced me that I was happy and didn’t have to pursue the click. However, after some meditation I couldn’t justify what good comfort would do for me, as basically everything important in life happens because of logic. When I procrastinate, and do tasks at the last possible moment, it is only because the objective reality has caught up to me, and my only option is to do the task. Without comfort, I would be able to carry out tasks without procrastination. All comfort did throughout my whole life was made me feel that “everything is fine” even though there were glaring issues, comfort made me sit down and forget about the world and its problems.\n\nI was now fully committed to try clicking and I felt I knew how I would be able to. I basically memorized my whole life, and saw how comfort was always a part of my actions. After graduating school, I started getting addicted to video games, and all I did was try to become as good as possible at the games to get in game recognition, while forgetting about the outside world and live in my own comfort bubble. This led me to gain a lot of weight and become morbidly obese. \nThe way I went about the click itself was probably quite unique. I tried talking to my “inner child” but it just didn’t work for me. So instead I imagined my “worst self” basically the version of me I was when comfort had consumed me the most, and compared it to a “best version” of myself, with logic as his core value. This is where the emotions absolutely overwhelmed me. I could not deny that comfort would lead me nowhere good. When I ate too much junk food, it was because of comfort making me feel good temporarily, but disregarding the long-term damage I was doing.  While logic was doing what, it was designed to do in my body, and trying to keep me healthy, with the junk I my body. That was the point I started to get very emotional, my weight has been an issue for me for many years, and I had always known I couldn’t continue ignoring the issues, and finding a cause for it, rather than just accepting that “there was something wrong with me” was really eye opening. I was in an incredibly emotional state at this point. I knew that this must be the real click, so I watched a video about Fibonacci numbers while my comfort was at its weakest: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ToUaU4vPks) \n\nAfter the video, I felt tremendous relief. I felt at ease, and the problems I envisioned in the future were no longer a thought.  After the click I became a lot more emotional. If I did something that was illogical because of impulse, I would feel incredible dissonance and would have to redo it if possible. For example, before the click I was quite a messy person, being in a dirty environment didn’t bother me at all. But after the click, if I sat down on my couch while I knew I had dirty dishes waiting, I was not able to sit knowing I had something more logical to do. Also, one of the first things I did was research about animal products, and I became vegan almost instantaneously. \n\nI was now in a state where I didn’t have to think about what to do next. It basically just came to me, and I would have to do it. Another thing was food no longer was a reoccurring thought as it usually was. I was usually the kind of person who would contemplate what I wanted to eat many times throughout the day. But after the click, I only thought about food when I felt hungry. I felt amazing for these 2 days. But unfortunately, I would have a setback.\n\n**Unclick**\nAfter a couple days of pure bliss, living with logic as the core value I now had tasks to attend. But a combination of anxiety and procrastination hindered me in going out and do what I had to do. I basically went against my core value and experienced incredible dissonance. The anxiety in itself was nowhere near as predominant as it used to be, in fact the dissonance I felt from not doing what I had to do was way stronger, but I ignored it and tried doing “the second most” logical things like watch some documentaries, but I realized that I just not could shake this dissonance away before I had done my task. I didn’t do what I had to do that day, and when I woke up the next day I no longer had logic as my core value. I had basically ignored the 4th step, and it had costed me dearly. When I had, unclicked I was not completely aware for the next day and half. I spent the day doing only logical things but I would realize that I did not have the same emotional desire as I had previously, and I was using discipline to do it.\nWhen I unclicked I went back to my complete old and worst self. At this point I decided, to let comfort take the reins for some time, and use it as material to trying to click again. After only 3 days, my home looked absolutely terrible. I had done nothing productive, I went back to overeating, not working out, leaving my apartment in absolute mess. And all of that in exchange for momentarily pleasures I got from playing games and watching other forms of entertainment.  I thought I would need couple of weeks to get enough material to feel equipped to try reclicking, but after 3 days I was confident I was able to. In fact my comfort was trying to make me procrastinate with the click and wait a couple of weeks, but I forced myself to go through with it, even though I now also had a great fear of clicking and losing it again forever.\n\n**Reclick**\nThe way I went about reclicking was basically comparing my 2 days with logic as my core value, and the last 3 days with comfort. It was actually incredibly easy for me to reclick and it only took 15 minutes. Again, my health was playing a big role. I knew that I had gone back to my worst self in terms of overeating, and it would lead to getting fat again If I let comfort control me. And on the other hand, logic would only move me forward. I would be able to do everything I had to do without procrastination, I would be able to understand the world, to be productive without forcing myself with discipline. Comparing these two scenarios I again felt immense negative emotions towards comfort as I did in the first click. This time I also watched the same Fibonacci video, and afterwards I meditated and tried to see if I had really clicked. I reasoned it was pretty pointless though, because I knew exactly how it felt having logic as core value, and the emotional drive I previously had to do logical decisions. So, I just went on with my day, to see if I had really clicked or not. First thing I did was clean my home without effort. Afterwards I did math I wanted to do for a while. I had incredible clarity, and understood it without easily. When I was done, I did my exercises I had neglected the last 3 days. This also came easy to me and required no discipline. When I was done, exercising I researched about vegan nutrition, and went to the marked to buy what I needed to sustain a healthy plant based diet. When I got back home I started reading “Real Answers” very thoroughly, watching videos about concept I didn’t understand while reading. I could now sincerely say I had an emotional drive to understand everything.\n\nThe day after I woke up after just 5 hours of sleep, was not tired and woke up immediately. First thing I did was go out and do some task I had previously procrastinated about, and when I got home I watched a documentary and now writing this testimony in the hopes of being able to help others click.\nI am absolutely aware how important the 4th step is now, and I have no intentions of going against my emotional logical drives. \n\n**Aftermath:**\nI am currently restructuring my life. I have decided to learn about the human anatomy. It is eye opening how much I took my own body for granted, consumed absolute junk, and just expecting everything to be fine. I want to learn and understand how every system in my body functions. This obviously has an emotional importance to me as I was previously very unhealthy. \n\nSecondly, I need to sort out my financial situation. I have a debt I need to pay, and need to figure out the most effective way to go about that. I also realize that the environment plays a big role in how we progress, and applying to the crew would be the most logical step, but I need to become financially independent first. \n\nLastly, I still experience remnants of the past. However, I am now very well equipped to deal with them. When my thoughts sometimes ponder about unimportant things, I can observe my thoughts as an observer and simply smile at them. Also, I feel like I can control and stop useless thoughts I have.\n\nThank you for reading about my journey, and good luck with clicking. It is absolutely real, and will change your life if you put in the effort, and approach it with an open mind.\n","createdAt":1480518256,"score":10,"author":"zochiy","id":"5fq1qz"},{"title":"So close to clicking but not able to throw away comfort","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5fov4h/so_close_to_clicking_but_not_able_to_throw_away/","selftext":"Tonight I tried the yo-yo technique for making the click at step 3.\n\nI thought about how much I love logic and all that logic provides, then I thought about how much pain comfort causes me.

Esta es la historia de cómo conseguí hacer el click.\nHace varios meses, escuchaba el podcast de Athene con bastante admiración. Yo quiero cambiar el mundo, mejorarlo. La idea de que nuestro entorno es lo que nos hace y por ende somos nuestro entorno fue una idea que me encantó y me alteró mi forma de vivir el día a día. Sin embargo, yo notaba en Athene y en otras figuras exitosas un ingrediente que a mi me faltaba. Esto me frustraba y me hacía caer en la rutina una vez más, después lo recordaría pero no haría nada al respecto, lo que me generaba mayor molestia.\n\nHace una semana volví a ver los videos de Athene cuando noté que dejaban de ser acerca de su plataforma de streaming. Entendí bastante rápido de qué se trataba y me fascinó haber encontrado ese ingrediente faltante. Luego de hablar con un clicker en discord tuve lo que me gusta denominar como pre-click, fue un click placebo que me ayudó a completar el paso 1 y a generar experiencias positivas teniendo un camino lógico en mis actuaciones, estas actuaciones tuvieron un papel fundamental en el Paso 3. Cuando viví este pre-click fui a mi casa y desinstalé todos mis juegos de pc, juegos que yo anteponía a mis obligaciones y que prefería antes que mi desarrollo como persona. Ese día me sentí MUY bien.\n\nAl día siguiente me junté con un amigo que ya le había comentado sobre mi frustración de estos meses y le hablé sobre este nuevo enfoque. Debatiendo sobre el tema saltaron muchas preguntas y situaciones que no había considerado como por ejemplo: qué pasaría con mi novia? Estoy en una feliz relación que ya pasaron los 3 años, si hago este click mi nueva forma de pensar, la descartaría? Volví a mi casa y se lo comenté a un clicker, este me dijo lo que yo en el fondo ya sabía: \"qué es más importante, mejorar la humanidad o estar con tu novia?\". Entonces, al día siguiente, me junté con ella a hablar de esto. Ya habíamos hablado de cómo nuestros objetivos de vida no eran los mismos y cómo, en definitiva, podrían significar una separación si el momento lo ameritaba. Ella tomó este recordatorio de una manera muy lógica y tranquila. Esto me dejó tranquilo a mí y luego se me ocurrió que ella podía clickear también.\n\nIdentificar mi valor núcleo (o principal; \"core value\") me costó. Yo escuché la meditación para el Paso 2 pero la tuve que escuchar una segunda vez para que me haga un buen efecto (la impredecibilidad de lo que podía decir me desconcentraba). Lo pensé bastante rato, horas con la idea en la cabeza tratando de descifrarlo. Finalmente se hizo más claro cuando fui completamente honesto conmigo: era la aceptación de los demás. Entendí que varias de mis memorias que más detestaba estaban directamentes relacionadas con eso y cómo yo me ponía en situaciones desventajosas sólo para que el otro tuviera una mejor imagen de mí. Mismo el motivo por el cual quería cambiar al mundo estaba relacionado con esto, fue interesante reconocerlo.\n\nEl Paso 3 fue sin duda el más difícil, pero pude encontrar un método que espero les pueda servir:\nLo primero que hice fue tratar de recordar esos momentos que me ayudaron a identificar mi valor principal anterior, memorias a las cuales yo le tenía bronca y odio.\nLo segundo fue recordar cómo fue ese día del pre-click y la buenísima sensación que me dio borrar los juegos, absorbí esa experiencia emocionalmente y me daba mucha satisfacción.\nDespués empecé a intercalar estas emociones, primero recordaba esos malos momentos y sentía esa bronca y odio, después iba a mi recuerdo pre-click, luevo volvía al mal momento y así varias veces. Repetí este proceso hasta que emocionalmente entendí y confié en la manera lógica y el cambio se hizo. No fue un borrón y cambiazo instantáneo sinó más bien una transición donde el valor principal anterior se iba desvaneciendo y mi niño interior iba agarrando este nuevo valor que se hacía más fuerte.\n\nDespués del click me sentí libre. Ahora nada me molesta como antes. Puedo levantarme temprano, ir al gimnasio, todo sin problema.\nLo que me pasó varias veces fue que encontraba a mi cuerpo haciendo actos involuntarios que correspondían a mi yo anterior, ahí entendí la importancia del paso 4, pensar todo devuelta, cosa que sigo en proceso para fortalecer mi lógica. También sentí que tenía que contárselo a mi amigo y a mi novia.\n\nGracias por leer y espero que esto les sea de ayuda\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnglish version\n\nHello, I live in Uruguay and I am 22 years old. This is the story of how I got the click.\nSeveral months ago, I listened to Athene's podcast with admiration. I want to change the world, improve it. The idea that our environment is what makes us and therefore we are this environment was an idea that I loved and altered my way of living day to day. However, I noticed in Athene and other successful figures an ingredient that I lacked. This frustrated me and made me fall into the routine once more, then I would remember but not do anything about it, which caused more annoyance.\n\nA week ago I returned to watch Athene's videos when I noticed that they stopped being about his streaming platform . I understood quite quickly what it was about and I was fascinated to have found that missing ingredient. After speaking with a clicker on discord I had what I like to call a pre-click: it was a placebo click that helped me complete step 1 and also generate positive experiences taking a logical path in my actions, these actions played a fundamental role in Step 3. When I lived this pre-click I went to my house and uninstalled all my pc games, games that I put before my obligations and preferred before my development as a person. That day I felt VERY good.\n\nThe next day I joined a friend who I had already commented on my previous frustrations and I talked about this new approach. While debating on the subject, many questions emerged, situations that I had not considered such as: what would happen to my girlfriend? I'm in a happy 3-year-long relationship, if I make this click would my new way of thinking get rid of her? I returned to my house and I told a clicker, he told me what I basically knew: \"what is more important, improving humanity or being with your girlfriend?\". Then, the next day, I asked her to talk about this. We had already talked about how our life goals were not the same and how, ultimately, could mean separation. She took this reminder in a very logical and calm way. This let me calm down and then it occurred to me that she could click too.\n\nIdentifying my core value was hard. I listened the meditation for Step 2 but I had to listen to it a second time for it to be effective (the unpredictability of what happens deconcentrated me). I thought about it for a while, hours with the idea in my head trying to decipher it. Eventually it became clearer when I was completely honest with myself: it was validation. I understood that several of my memories that I most detested were directly related to that and how I put myself in disadvantageous situations just so that others had a better image of me. Even the reason why I wanted to change the world was related to this, it was interesting to recognize it.\n\nStep 3 was undoubtedly the most difficult, but I could find a method that I hope will serve you:\nThe first thing I did was try to remember those moments that helped me to identify my previous core value, memories to which I felt anger and hatred.\nSecondly was to remember how that pre-click day was and how good I felt deleting those games, I absorbed that experience emotionally and it gave me a lot of satisfaction.\nThen I began to interweave these emotions, first I remembered those bad moments and I felt that anger and hatred, then I went to my pre-click memory, then I returned to the bad moment and so several times. I repeated this process until I emotionally understood and relied on logic and the change was made. It was not a spontaneous changeover but rather a smooth transition where the previous core value was fading and my inner child was grabbing this new value that became stronger.\n\nAfter the click I felt free. Now nothing bothers me as before. I can get up early, go to the gym, all with no problem.\nWhat happened to me several times was that I found my body doing involuntary acts that corresponded to my previous self, there I understood the importance of step 4, re-think what surrounds you, which I am still in process to strengthen my logic. I also felt that I had to tell my friend and my girlfriend.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope this helps.\n","createdAt":1480423030,"score":8,"author":"lingonga","id":"5fieeq"},{"title":"What is this place and what is a \"click\"?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5fhd3b/what_is_this_place_and_what_is_a_click/","selftext":"What is this stuff?","createdAt":1480404245,"score":14,"author":"TheCommissarGeneral","id":"5fhd3b"},{"title":"How to get to logic trigger pleasure and illogicality trigger pain ?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5ffp6t/how_to_get_to_logic_trigger_pleasure_and/","selftext":"I read the 4 steps, listened to the meditative audio, watched logic finds god  but it still doesn't make any sense to me.

In the first year, I spent most of my free time studying as all subjects were more or less brand new and I had a lot of learning to do. In the second year, in which I am now, I did not study as much, because I had already gotten ahead of the pack, improved my studying technique, and overall found subjects such as mathematics and physics a lot easier now that I had been learning them for an entire year. Since I did not have to work as hard in the second year I focused my efforts on starting my business.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe business that I was about to start was a web development and marketing company that would help me become ‘financially independent’. I choose to define financial independence as having enough money to live a minimalistic lifestyle on my own for at least one year and having the ‘skills to pay the bills’. In other words, having $10 000 on my bank account and the ability to make a living whenever I would need to.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also said that I indulged in personal development. Indeed, that was the case, and also one of the reasons why my core value of comfort was so functional. I started doing personal development work when I was around 13 years old and this enabled me to rid myself of many identity issues as well as overcome things such as procrastination and laziness. For instance, in my seventh year of elementary school/grade school I averaged a D in grades (this was prior to my taking up personal development). While during my ninth, and last, year I finished with straight A’s and one B. The reason why I was able to make such a radical shift was because of the personal development work that I completed as it enabled me to overcome procrastination, develop a solid work ethic, and have a bright vision for what I would achieve in the future (which motivated me to work on in the present). One of my personal development goals was to start my own business and become financially independent, so that I then could focus on helping as many people as possible, hence I was actively working on that prior to making the click. An additional form of personal development that I enjoyed was the [Real Talk](https://soundcloud.com/athenepodcast).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI listened to all of the [Real Talk Podcasts](https://soundcloud.com/athenepodcast) and frequently tuned in to the [Real Talk Live Stream](https://www.gamingforgood.net/s/athenelive). By doing this I patched up many flaws in my belief system – by using logic – that had come into existence thanks to the faulty conceptualisations of my old core value.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOverall, at this point, as I was starting my first year of gymnasium I had an incredibly structured, functional, and yes, logical lifestyle compared to most people. I was working out on a consistent basis, eating very healthily, was very happy, had developed an insane work ethic, and was highly driven to achieve my ambitious goals in personal development and contribution to the world. The flaws that remained was a lack of self-confidence, the need to use discipline and motivation to follow through with tasks rather than completing them from a place of flow, and the self-centeredness of my goals. Looking back, I can pinpoint the cause of these flaws: the rational parts of my brain not being in line with the emotional parts of my brain; and I can explain the cause of this cause: my core value – my emotional drive – was comfort rather than logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###Motivations for Making the Click\n\nI desired to make the click from the get go as I knew of all the benefits of having logic as your core value (e.g. total peace and clarity of mind, choiceless and selfless awareness, intrinsic sense of self-confidence, etc.) Check out this link for the full list of benefits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI desired to make the click from the get-go as I was familiar with the benefits of having logic as one’s core value (e.g. total peace and clarity of mind, choiceless and selfless awareness, real self-confidence, etc.) [Check out this link for a more comprehensive list of benefits.](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Main_Page#What_will_happen_after_you_make_the_click)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was also very driven to make the click because I understood that it would enable me to be a lot more efficient at everything that I would do, which in turn would make it easier for me to achieve anything that I set out to achieve.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###Main Obstacles with Making the Click\n\nMy biggest obstacle was not being able to connect negative emotions to my old core value: comfort. It is understandable that I struggled with this given how functional my life was thanks to the personal development work that I had indulged in and the loving environment I had grown up in. Nonetheless, by putting in hard, focused and consistent work for 6 days straight, I managed to overcome the obstacle – I clicked. In this post, I will share in great detail, how I went about this process.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the beginning, I also struggled to find my core value. However, I managed to overcome this quickly in comparison to the struggles I had with step 3.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Step 1: Develop Unconditional Trust In Logic\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere are five things that helped me develop unconditional trust in logic on an emotional level. They are…\n\n1. Understanding the benefits of clicking.\n2. Understanding that our reality is brought about by logic and that everything can be explained logically.\n3. Understanding that logic has brought about all modern luxuries and provides for all my safety.\n4. Understanding that logic is a tool that will help me achieve anything.\n5. Personifying logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPoints 1 and 2 speak primarily to the rational part of your brain, and hence are insufficient to develop an emotional connection to logic. Nevertheless, having followed them will give you a solid foundation going into points 3 and 4 (particularly if you struggle to understand why logic is good for you), which speak to the emotional side of you. Point 5 is only to be practiced once you’ve developed an initial emotional trust for logic (because it won’t work otherwise), and acts as a catalyst that intensifies your faith.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1) **Understanding the benefits of clicking.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo follow point one, all that I did, and all you have to do, is to watch the documentary [Science Finds God?](https://youtu.be/SXDw73rToPE), read this description of what will happen once you click, and optionally, read a couple of posts by clickers that explain their experience with logic as their core value.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2) **Understanding that reality is brought about by logic and that everything can be explained logically.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI already had a solid understanding that everything was brought about by logic, and could be explained logically, due to my background in science and extensive use of logic in day-to-day life. Nevertheless, I decided that I would watch the [recommended documentaries](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Content_to_help_you_appreciate_logic#Documentaries) to solidify my understanding of how our world, ultimately, is logical. After watching documentaries for three or four days, I had gained new insights that would help me trust logic. For instance, I learned what fractals are – a geometrical figure that exhibits a repeating pattern that displays at every scale – and that they are everywhere to be found in nature: ranging from snowflakes, flowers, and mountains, to crystal and galaxy formations. However, I had also realised that I was using information gathering as a means to procrastinate following the actual steps. This realisation struck me hard, and caused me to experience a lot of dissonance to the point where I actively began following the [Four Steps](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Main_Page#Four_steps_to_logic_as_your_new_core_value). This is when I took on point three.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Content to help you appreciate logic...](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Content_to_help_you_appreciate_logic)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3) **Understand that logic has brought about all modern luxuries and provides for all your safety.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter having watched the recommended documentaries, and thus having developed an understanding of how the world is made of logic, I proceeded with trying to understand, on an emotional level, how logic would help me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n…but how?\n\nThere is only one thing that I did, but exhaustively. *I channelled my positive emotional attachments to logic by understanding how these ‘things’ that I connected positive emotions to only are possible thanks to logic.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Note:** It’s good if you follow the first and second point of advice before taking on this one. The reason: You must be able to explain to your inner child – your emotional core – that the ‘things’ that you connect positive emotions to are only possible thanks to logic (this may require insight into how our reality can be explained through mathematical patterns).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo how do you channel current positive emotional attachments to logic?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThink of numerous ‘things’ that you already correlate positive emotions to. For instance, this might be a boyfriend/girlfriend, a loved one, a friend, an activity, your house, a piece of technology, the Internet, nature, and so on. Then, explain these ‘things’ through logic. And lastly, channel your feelings and emotions for these ‘things’ to logic (as you understand that it is logic that has brought them about). In other words, understand how what you value on an emotional level, is brought about by logic, and thus link that positive feeling to logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor example, if you have someone whom you love dearly, visualise that person and let yourself feel those positive emotions that you connect to him/her (remember great memories you have together, things that you do, reasons why you love the person, and so on). Once you’ve generated these positive emotions, stop for a moment, and realise how it's logic that has granted you everything you hold dear about this person and these emotions. Understand that if it was not for logic – the mathematical patterns that bring about reality – you would not experience any of these emotions. In fact, the feeling of love, and the different stages of love, has by neuroscientists been pinpointed to a few hormonal combinations, such as testosterone and estrogen in cases of lust; dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin during attraction; and oxytocin as well as vasopressin in long-term relationships. These hormones can in turn be broken down into atoms, which can be broken down into protons, neutrons, and electrons, which can be subdivided into quarks – particles with mere mathematical properties. If the chemicals that are responsible for your sense of love are comprised of quarks (which merely have mathematical properties), and these particles are the building blocks of the entire universe, the notion that everything ultimately is mathematical does not seem so far fetched anymore. Once you understand that ‘love’ (or anything else) is brought about by ‘logic’, you can link your feelings of ‘love’ to ‘logic’, hence building a bridge between the two concepts.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNote that this example builds upon a very simple three-step process: \n\ni) Think of something you correlate positive emotions to.\n\nii) Understand that these things and emotion are brought about by logic.\n\niii) Link these emotions to logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis process can be transferred to practically any other thing that you connect a positive emotion to.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor instance, rather than explaining how an emotion is brought about by logic, you may investigate how your house, heating system, and grocery store is only possible thanks to human application of logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen following the process for channelling your present emotional attachments to logic, there is a very minor, but nonetheless needle moving, distinction that can help you understand how logic provides for all your safety.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDistinction: While reflecting on the ‘things’ that that you connect positive emotions to (e.g. your house, a loved one, video games, etc.) and how they’re brought about by logic, also reflect on how these ‘things’ give you safety. Doing so will enable you to channel the emotion of safety to logic. Emotionally understanding how logic brings you safety is very helpful later on, when working on step 3 and trying to convince your inner child that logic provides you more safety than your current core value.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4) **Understand that logic is a tool that will help you achieve anything.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSimultaneously, while I was reflecting on how logic has brought about all modern luxuries and provides for all my safety, I let my goals come to mind and projected myself into the future to have a peak at how the outcomes would differ if I had logic as my core value rather than comfort. Seeing that the outcome always would turn out better with logic as my core value helped me increase my trust for logic.'\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRationally, it is easy to wrap your head around that logic is what gives you the highest probability of achieving any desired outcome. After all, reality is governed by mathematical patterns – human rationality enables us to conceptualise these patterns – and hence they can be leveraged to our advantage when navigating the world. For instance, it was reasoning that made it possible for us to invent things such as clothes, hunting weapons, and houses; harness the power of fire; and build complex networks of collaboration: all things that all increased our quality of life and odds of survival.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFurthermore, and as we concluded in the third point, it is no secret that all great advancements were only made possible thanks to logic. Take, for example, the exploration of space, the invention of the Internet, or the development of computers; would any of these be possible without understanding the mathematical patterns that govern reality and using logic as a tool to make use of those patterns? Of course, the answer is no.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo exemplify additionally, we can turn to poker. On the surface, poker may seem a game of chance. You draw a set of cards, can discard your cards for randomly picked new ones, and then, whoever has the best hand wins. But some players, win significantly more frequently than others. Why is that? Is it because they have ‘luck’ on their side? Those who are familiar with poker are inclined to believe otherwise. Professional or high-winning poker players are very strategic with their every move, and try to base their plays on probabilities. Their win-rate is thus determined by how accurately they’re able to estimate the probabilities of specific actions leading to certain outcomes. In other words, the difference between a successful poker play and a less successful one, is that the one more successful has a better understanding of probabilities: of logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLikewise, this is present in economics and the stock market. Successful stock trades are merely better at calculating the probability of their investments turning into profit, than unsuccessful ones. The same applies in all other areas of life. The better you are at finding what is most likely to lead you to your desired outcome, the more successful you will be in that area.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe above text can help us warp our heads around how logic gives us the highest chances of success on a rational level, but how do we accomplish the same on an emotional one?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe process that I went through is rather straight forward. Simply, I compared and visualised how the outcome of small tasks, key work activities, and lofty goals would turn out if I had logic versus comfort as my core value. During this process I realised two different things. Firstly, and quite immediately, I understood that logic is far superior to comfort when it comes to getting things done and achieving whatever you set out to achieve. (This became obvious as I could see my actions and what outcomes they lead in my visualisations.) Secondly, I came to the realisation that by clinging on to comfort I was shooting myself and hindering myself from achieving my goals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe result of this activity: an emotional understanding that logic would indeed help me achieve anything.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Summary of Process:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni) Decide on a situation in which you will compare your current core value to logic.\n\nii) Visualise how the situation plays out with your current core value. (How do you act? What outcome do your actions lead to? How do you feel throughout?)\n\niii) Visualise how the situations plays out with logic as your core value. (How do you act? What outcome do your actions lead to? How do you feel throughout?)\n\niv) Comment on your findings and link appropriate emotions to your current core value and to logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pro Tip 1:** You can continually work on step 1 by always being of observant of the things that you take for granted, understand how it is due to logic that they exist, and thus connect the positive feeling that you have for them, to logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pro Tip 2:** Regularly ask yourself ‘How would this activity/situation feel, and what outcome could I expect, if I had logic as my core value rather than my current one?’ Seeing the activity play out from the perspectives of both core values is key, as it will make you notice the qualitative and quantitative differences between the two.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n5) **Personify logic**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce I had developed an initial trust for logic, I went on to personifying it in order to strengthen my faith. In other words, I visualised logic as an ‘individual’ and/or a ‘something’ that I could trust unconditionally. Specifically, I began by personifying logic as dear friend, paladin and wise teacher.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe looked something like this:\n- http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/b/b5/Crusader-portrait1.png/revision/latest?cb=20140625090007\n\n- http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f49c9916b4427f77d4fa759cc30eed76.jpg\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBy personifying logic as a paladin figure, I had constructed a mental object that I could easily recall, and hence use as a link to logic. Aside from helping me smoothly connect to logic, the visual construct enabled me to look upon logic as something that I could trust to always be there for me. I felt as if I could always turn to my friend (logic), had I any questions or concerns. I felt as if I would never be alone, always supported, and always have logic to lean back on. It is hard to describe this feeling through mere words, but it was like being in a plain of total darkness, with unwavering faith and trust and warmth in my heart, that I would never be alone. This lead to a monumental intensification of my trust for logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, I did not settle for personifying logic as one thing. I felt like playing with the strategy of personification, and thus also personified logic as a gorgeously looking girl, that I could connect feelings of love and attraction to, as well as a God or a light that would always watch over me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Warcraft Art to Illustrate the Light](http://cdn.blizzardwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tirion_Redemption_TCG_2.jpg)\n\n[Art From Rapunzel to Illustrate the Light](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140329162719/disney/images/6/6d/ScreenHunter_01_Mar._14_20.07.jpg)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLater on, while I was working on step 3, I would come to return to this strategy of personification and personify logic as a miniature of the universe, a ring, and an ethereal arcane power that would merge with the body of my inner child, make it drop the truthfully malicious and sinister teddy bear of comfort, and grant it the power to transform into a mighty dragon that would infuse my mind with wisdom and strength, and orbit the face of the Earth to purge it of illogic. By vividly letting this play out in my mind I managed to make the leap of faith [let go of my old core value and taking up logic] to logic. I will explain the leap of faith in more detail later on in Step 3.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Note:** After clicking, I still leverage my personifications to stay connected with logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Note:** It’s critically important to experience the emotional states throughout this process, and it’s not enough to merely think about them. Visualisation and recalling positive memories related to your personification (e.g. a friend) can help you feel these emotions.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Points to Ponder:**\n* Logic – the mathematical patterns that govern reality – is your creator, your God. Don’t read the bible, read reality.\n* Logic will take care of you like a friend that's always there by your side.\n* Logic will take care of you like a friend that's always there by your side. \n* The reason for asking a question tells you a lot more than answer to the question itself.\n\n---\n\n#Step 2: Find What Emotionally Drives You\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere are three things that helped me find what drove me on an emotional level:\n\n1. Reviewing all significant events and processes that took place in my life from my earliest memories until now, and trying to identify how they influenced me and what values they may have given rise to.\n2. Thinking about numerous significant events/processes in my life, and getting to the core of what drove me in those situations by asking ‘why questions’.\n3. Thinking about numerous significant actions/behaviours that I habitually indulged in, and getting to the core of what drove me to do them by asking ‘why questions’.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFollowing point one may not take you all the way to knowing your core value (although it might), but it will give you a lot of insight into why you took certain decisions in the past and how your environment has moulded you into who you are today. (At lest it did for me.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPoints two and three are directly designed to get to the bottom of what drives you: your core value. Follow them properly and you can rest assured that you’ve completed Step 2.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1) **Review all key events and process that took place in your life from your earliest memories until now.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA key event is a specific moment that was of monumental significance to how your ‘character and identity’ was shaped. An example of a key event could be if you almost drowned when you were a child, and hence developed a chronical fear of water. Key events do not have to be this dramatic. They must simply be of significance to how your ‘character and identity’ was shaped.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA key process is either a series of key events or repeated happenings that were of monumental significance to how your ‘character and identity’ was forged. An example of a key process could be that you were bullied at school, and hence developed low self-esteem which lead to you to sitting and playing video games all day in the comfort of your home.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll people have moments in their lives that left an imprint. By remembering them and logically explaining how these moments affected you (and why they affected you in that way) you can find clues to your core value. The process for doing this is very straightforward:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni) Recall key events/processes.\n\nii) Strive to understand their causes and consequences.\n\niii) Look for patterns in causes and consequences to see if you can identify an underlying driving force behind your actions and behaviours: your core value.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Note:** If you’re family has told you stories of a traumatising event that took place when you were a toddler, and you can’t remember that event, you may choose to use those stories as tools to understand why you behaved as you did in your later years. However, if you choose to do this, make sure to be aware of the possibility that the story your family has told you is distorted or flat out incorrect.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI will give you an authentic example from my own life that illustrates the three-step process. Keep in mind that the events in this key process are from my early childhood.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUsed to talk to people → Traumatic Event: Was at day care and was left alone in the forest (left for dead by the group) → Stopped Talking to All People (except family) → Introversion (e.g. did not speak to anyone at day care; only spoke to teachers when it was an absolute must in lower school) → Progressively (with age) Became Less Severely Introverted (e.g. started making friends)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThrough a reflection as the one exemplified, you could start to understand how your environment moulded you to act and behave like you do today, which in turn could help you become less attached to your past and help you identify your core value. Personally, this example provided me with a likely answer to why I used to be severely anti-social in my early childhood – something that I couldn’t understand before.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Note:** The importance of being brutally honest with yourself during this process can’t be stressed enough. Frankly, unless you’re completely honest with yourself while reflecting on what your core value is, you’re wasting your time and energy as you’ll find no or false answers. So please… be brutally honest, and ‘dig deep’.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pro Tip:** Write down your reflections. Writing them down will help you stay structured and focused, and you’ll be able to return to them whenever you need to without having to go through the whole process again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2) **Think of numerous significant events/processes in your life, and get to the core of what drove you in those situations by asking ‘why questions’.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis second and third point of advice for following Step 2 is in a sense very similar to the first point. The only real difference is that you’ll be focused on a few key events and you’ll be asking ‘why questions’ to get to the bottom of why you acted the way you did. For me, this approach got me to my core value within a matter of minutes. Nonetheless, I continued analysing more significant events/processes until I had a good sample (about 15) that all pointed to the same core value. There were a few samples that didn’t point to comfort being my core value, but since the values they pointed to were in minority and similar to comfort, I simply discarded them as it was more probable the most frequently occurring value was my core value.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you find several values, you can consider discarding all but one. However, make sure the value you keep appears more frequently than the other ones. If it’s a close race, examine if the given values are of similar character (e.g. fitting in and validation are very similar). If they are, they might merely be different labels for the same thing. If this is the case, choose whichever label you prefer, and you’re good to go: you know your core value.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo here’s how you go about this piece of advice…\n\ni) Remember a key event/process of choice and let it play out in your mind (visualisation may help).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nii) Ask ‘why questions’ that guide you in the direction of what emotionally drove you to act/behave in the way you did.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pro Tip:** Writing down your reflection may help you be more structured and can be handy for future reference.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo give a general example, you’ll want to ask questions such as…\n\n**Q:** ‘Why do I do X?’ | **A:** ‘Because it gives my Y’\n\n**Q:** ‘But why do I want Y?’ | **A:** ‘Because Y is Z.’\n\n…and so on, until you find what ultimately drove you to act/behave in the way you did.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFollow the above described process for numerous actions/behaviours so that you truly know that you’ve found your core value. (How do you know that you’ve truly found your core value. You do not. But if the same value appears consistently, that’s a very strong indicator that is your core value.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, I will give you a genuine example of when I used this process and asked ‘why questions’ to get to my core value.\n\n**Q:** ‘Why did I do so much personal development work?’ | **A:** ‘Because it made me feel good.’\n\n**Q:** In what way? | **A:** It raised my self-esteem and made me feel more confident, gave me goals and visions to strive for, and overall gave me enduring happiness, control, and direction.\n\n**Q:** Why do I want to have a high self-esteem and feel confident? | **A:** To feel comfortable in all social settings.\n\n**Q:** Why do I want that? | **A:** Because it makes me feel safe. (Indicates that Core Value = Comfort)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3) **Think about numerous (significant) actions/behaviours that you habitually indulge in, and get to the core of what drives you to do them.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo follow point three, you’ll follow the same steps as in point two, except that your focus will be on your actions and behaviours rather than events and processes. Therefore, I will not give further explanation on how to follow point three. However, I will provide you with an authentic example from my own reflection.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Example:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Q:** Why do I feel anxious/afraid to have a call with a clicker, when he/she is going to help me make the click?\n\n**A:** Because I’m afraid of what my family members/the clicker will think of me?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Q:** Why am I afraid of that?\n**A:** Because I want to be accepted by them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Q:** Why do I want to be accepted by my family members and the clickers?\n\n**A1:** Because they [my family] provides me with safety and comfort, and I want to keep their validation so that I don’t loose out on that? (Indicates Core Value = Comfort)\n- *Comment:*But… this is flawed because when I have logic as my core value I will just be free from the need of social validation and get more safety and comfort in any situation (which I btw really would like). After all, with comfort as my core value I might feel comfortable in my room, with logic I can feel comfortable anywhere.\n\n*A2:** Because I don’t want the clicker to regard me as stupid.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Q:** Why don’t I want the clicker to regard me as stupid?\n\n**A:** Because I don’t feel confident enough to be invalidated by a clicker – someone whom I want to become like.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Q:** Why don’t I want to be invalidated by someone whom I want to become like?\n\n**A:** Because that would make me feel stupid, and thus uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Q:** Why do I want to avoid feeling uncomfortable?\n\n**A:** Because I derive a sense of safety from comfort. (Indicates that Core Value = Comfort)\n\n---\n\n#Step 3: Realise That Your Current Core Value Does Not Provide as Much Safety as Logic\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere are four things that helped me find what drove me on an emotional level:\n\n1. Visualising Logic vs. Comfort in a Range of Situations\n2. Understanding that my (and the masses’) flawed core value is directly responsible for all my (and all the world’s) problems.\n3. Consistently asking how I would respond to ‘this situation’ if I had logic versus comfort as my core value, and what the probable outcome would be.\n4. Personifying logic and comfort and visualising how I make the click.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first point is the heavy lifter, while the remaining act as support to keep moving the ball forward.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1) **Visualise Logic vs. [Insert Your Core Value] in a Range of Situations**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVisualising logic versus comfort in a range of situations, thoroughly cranked up the dissonance I felt for keeping comfort as my core value rather than switching to logic. This is how I went about my visualisations, and how I suggest you do too…\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ni) Remember the moments in your life where your current core value screwed you over (forgive the harsh language).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile doing this, keep in mind that the most important part of this process is to stir up negative emotions to the top of the cauldron, and then connect them to your current core value. To do this, review the moments you’ve decided to recall in great detail (visualisation may help), let yourself feel any emotions, and connect all negative emotions to your current core value by realising that it is thanks to it that you got ‘screwed over’.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nii) Review common ‘things’/scenarios that you’re unsatisfied with, and that are caused by your current core value.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nExamples of such ‘things’/scenarios include a lack of self-esteem, procrastination, inability to achieve what you want, destructive habits (e.g. eating unhealthily, sitting all day, smoking, etc.). Compare how these ‘things’/scenarios would differ if you had logic as your core value instead of the one you have now.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\niii) Review your biggest goals and play through them with your current core value and then logic. What are you seeing?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\niv) Project into the future and see how your current core value compares to logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously, this is what you’re already doing when follow point three. Anyhow, below you’ll find an elaboration…\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nStart by projecting 1 day into the future, then 1 month, then 1 year… 3 years, 5 years… 10, 20, 30, and 50 years into the future. What will your life be like, after all this time, if you keep your current core value rather than switching to logic? Will it be better or worse? Happier or sadder? Meaningful or thrown away? Go through all aspects of your life that matter to you, and compare the short-term and long-term outcomes that you will reap in those areas if you have your current core value versus if you have logic as your core value. The results of your evaluation will speak for themselves, and you can use them to emotionally decide whether logic is superior to your current core value or not.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2) **Understand that your (and the masses’) flawed core value is directly responsible for all your (and all the world’s) problems.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce I fully wrapped my head around this it gave rise to big time dissonance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt is thanks to the flawed core values of the world – comfort, validation seeking, love, etc. – that all modern problems that we so eagerly debate (but forget to act on) even exist. It is the inaction of the masses, their luxurious ignorance, that is the root cause to why there are hundreds of millions of children living in extreme poverty and dying gruesome deaths due to causes that could have been prevented with less than a dollar. It is the greed and self-centeredness of the people that our nations wage wars, our companies play cheap tricks to maximise profit, and our individuals are so deeply troubled by themselves that they egoistically indulge in self-aggrandising behaviours so that they, even for a moment, can receive recognition and/or look down upon others to derive a sense of superiority that masks their deeply felt unworthiness and lack of purpose. And it is the deflection of responsibility – through false rationalisations – that the masses allow themselves to carry out these atrocious acts without the slightest sense of guilt.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTherefore, I ask: ‘Isn’t your comfort, desperate need to fit in, or whatever your core value is, in fact, the most brutal form of ignorance disguised in royal garments?’ And I propose to you to look deeply to find answers to this question. Maybe you’ll realise how all of the world’s problems are indeed a consequence of the flawed beliefs of people – just like yourself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pro Tip:** Visualising all the suffering that is caused by your core value can help. For example, if you have comfort as your core value and like to play video games, you can visualise yourself sitting on top of a pile of bones while playing video games.\n\n---\n\n[**CLICK HERE FOR PDF VERSION OF MY POST**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwjM4hsYsMwqYXFBdXdBUV81Ums)","createdAt":1480263955,"score":31,"author":"Darnock58","id":"5f61os"},{"title":"My Click Experience and Tips (18, Canada)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5f4g4w/my_click_experience_and_tips_18_canada/","selftext":"My Experience with “The Click”\n\nBefore I discuss my experience with the click, I will introduce myself. I am 18 years old, and live in Canada. I clicked on November 26th, 2016, in the early evening. I hope this description of my experience will be helpful for others who may be struggling with similar hurdles to myself, and who may have fears, concerns, or doubts about the clicking process. My description will first describe a major bottleneck, some negative habits I had before the click, and then my experience with the four-step process.\n\nAbout two months ago, when I first started listening to the real talks, I began to adapt to a very logically structured lifestyle, which caused a **placebo click**. I thought I had achieved what Athene was speaking about, especially because I had several euphoric moments, but the trend did not hold. Although I changed several habits like my diet, and entertainment, I was still operating from a rational motivation. If I could only make one recommendation to help others along the process to clicking, it would be to focus on the **emotion**, because rationalization to avoid dissonance is very likely to fall apart.  \n\nSeveral negative habits (for myself) pre-click in no order:\n\n-\tUnregulated diet (Vegetarian, but supplemented with excess sugar, processed)\n\n-\tAlthough I meditated, it felt like an obligation\n\n-\tConsumption of alcohol\n\n-\tSchool (and grade) related stress\n\n-\tConsumption of entertainment, purely for entertainments sake\n\n-\tChecking my appearance in the mirror\n\n-\tSpending money to improve my appearance (clothing, shoes, etc).\n\n-\tIntellectual masturbation (among friends)\n\n-\t(THE BIG ONE) Following several of the patterns of the inter subjective reality that is the average university.\n\n\n**Step 1: Developing an unconditional trust in logic**\n\n**My Experience:** \tStep one was reasonably simple for me complete. I had used logic as a tool throughout my life, and it had proven to be very effective (especially to pump up my intellectual ego, but I will get back to that later!). It was easy to connect logic to feeling happy, and I would do this by visualizing the way that logic is behind so many positive things, all the way from the care of a mother towards her child, (I used this example for myself because it was strongly emotional, which was important for me, as rational thinking had not worked in the past), to mathematical problem solving.\n\n**Tips for Step 1:**\n \n-\tIf you currently use logic as a tool, try to connect the positive results of using logic to a positive emotion (and then later, you can work on replacing your existing core value – I needed baby steps).\n\n-\tIf logic is more abstract for you, try to follow positive emotions backwards, and often you may find that their source was based on a logical pattern. For example, for those who enjoy listening to music, enjoyment of a melody can be looked at as a connection between our brains reward center and mathematical relationships.\n \n**Step 2: Finding my emotional core value**\n\n**My Experience:**\tStep two was a challenge, and at times resulted in very negative emotions, but is absolutely worth the trouble. To identify my core value, I had to put every aspect of my life under scrutiny, as well as much of my past, and question my actions. At the beginning of the process I thought that my core value may have been knowledge, but this was far from the truth. During the questioning process, I tried to sit back and notice my tendencies. For example, throughout a normal day, I would assess why I was doing what I was doing. I questioned everything from my morning grumpiness to my tendency to zone out in a specific lecture, or the way I would have conversations with certain people versus others. This process created an extreme amount of dissonance. I began feeling angry about several of my habits (which was very useful for step 3). After about two weeks (quite long) I determined that my core value was comfort. I believe it took so long because I had constructed a shield around my self-esteem with my intellectual ability, which allowed me to find comfort very easily, and camouflaged the feeling of comfort into a sort of “superiority,” where I felt safe, high and dry above common struggles.\n\n**Tips for Step 2:**\n\n-\tIf you are like me, and are finding it hard to identify your current core value, it is quite likely comfort. This is because when you are comfortable, you have less dissonance, and it can be challenging to pinpoint negative trends that may seem unrelated.\n\n-\tStep 2 can be very unpleasant, although it can be a very helpful for step 3 to take note of this unpleasantness, and analyse why you may be having negative reactions to the scrutiny of your current life.\n\n**Step 3: Realizing that my current core value doesn’t provide as much safety as logic:**\n\n**My Experience:**\tStep three was by far the most explosive. I accomplished step three using semi-meditative strategies, alone, throughout the span of two days (climaxing with the click). My strategy was to write down two comprehensive lists. The first was a list of negative emotions, and where I believed they stemmed from. The second was a list of illogical, and nonsensical actions that I do regularly. I followed the elements of each list back to their source: my current core value. This was challenging for some, like the assessment of my stress related to achieving good grades, and easy for others, like my habit of watching television series at lunch time. Both lists, founded on the basis of comfort, were wildly misaligned with the objective reality. Using Athene’s recommendation of the “Yo-yo” effect, I would experience the pain and dissonance of my current value, and then visualize the way that logic could essentially destroy both lists. This process resulted in severe emotion, and had several physiological symptoms like sweating, shaking, volatile breath, and headaches (all of which may have also been caused by my irregular eating and exercise habits during these two days). \n\n**Finally, The Click:**   My click was very much a euphoric moment, but also extremely physiologically impactful. At the time, I was laying on the floor in the dark. The moment it happened, I felt very weightless, and began to smile and laugh. Instantly, I wanted to test it, so I put on my shoes on and ran out my door (it was dark, cold and raining at the time). The reason I chose to run is because under regular circumstances, I use running to escape, but this time I was going to scrutinize it. The euphoria continued, and as I moved along under massive trees and watched the rain fall in front of me I was overcome by a wonderful feeling: **OBJECTIVITY IS ECSTASY**. In that moment, I felt as though my reward center was being tied with the extent to which I am aligned with (and can understand) the objective reality, and by the same token, my acceptance of logic. \n\n**Tips for Step 3:**\n\n-\tTake advantage of dissonance. For example, in the same way that our bodies feel pain to help us avoid injury, experiencing dissonance can help us to pinpoint sources of, metaphorically, cognitive danger.\n\n-\tI found meditation-like practices to be very helpful, like breathing exercises, which helped me to feel present, as opposed to being concerned about the future.\n\nStep 4: Strengthening my trust in logic:\n\nStep four is an ongoing process, and I intend to continue to make more and more logical decisions. Following the click, I have noticed a change in several habits.\n\n**Since clicking, I have:**\n\n-\tHad a much easier time finding a meditative state\n-\tReformed myself to a strict plant-based diet\n-\tBegun to feel my social anxiety decrease\n-\tBegun to feel ego fade very dramatically\n-\tLost my stress related to grades, and begun to focus solely on learning\n-\tBegun to analyze the inter subjective environments that I exist within, and be deliberate about my actions within such realities.\n-\tFelt driven to share this concept with others (although can be challenging with my novice rhetorical ability). \n\nI would appreciate any and all feedback about this post, as well as scrutiny and criticism of any potential errors","createdAt":1480235961,"score":24,"author":"potatoeMountains","id":"5f4g4w"},{"title":"Click story","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5f4x6b/click_story/","selftext":"Hey guys how's it going?

The reason was because I was depressed and I was literally willing to do anything to get out of this depression. Basically I was trialling and erroring every self-help new age fad there was and none of it helped me. I thought hey, i have nothing to lose so I trialled this 'click' too.

Man, this blew my mind it was quite crazy. I felt so good.\n\n2\n\nMy core value was playing games. All I did before this click was playing games all day. No wonder I was depressed! I wasn't helping anyone, I wasn't helping myself, I wasn't helping my family. Yes indeed, my core value was comfort.\n\n3\n\nWhy am I doing this? I asked myself again and again and again. When I was playing LoL I wanted to play for social validation. I wanted to do good so my friends would say 'thanks for carrying me'. I wanted to get to diamond so my friends could say 'nice job man'. My core value was social validation.\n\nAlso do you guys know the game 'Undertale'? It's basically a game where you can choose to spare monsters or kill them. I was playing Undertale a lot also.

I was literally gaining self-worth by helping fictional characters. \n\n4\n\nI got off my lazy ass and went to work out, I started eating lentils. Buckwheat and oatmeal. I always knew the benefits of eating healthy, but I never applied them. After the click, I felt so happy, I felt I could just eat healthy so easy.

It was literally the perfect environment to read because everyone else in the library was also reading. If I was at home I surely would have just read like one paragraph and stopped. But the environment was perfect for reading and so I actually read the whole entire thing, focused, and read it till the very end.\n\nAfter reading these two articles, I developed a serious unconditional trust in logic. I started seeing everything around me in maths equations and symbols, I realised that I was also a combination of maths equations and symbols. It was quite a surreal experience and quite euphoric. it was a very big catharsis\n\nstep 2 / 3: after reading these articles however, I got bored and started reading some japanese comics. When I was reading I experienced so much inner conflict and dissonance. I realised that I was reading this to feel comfortable. But I asked myself, what is the point? What will happen if I finish this story? This story isn't even real. The characters are fictional. A lot of bad things happen, then they get fixed. I'm literally creating problems by reading this comic, and then solving them by reading some more. Like for example, when the main character's girlfriend gets kidnapped by gangsters, that creates a problem which made me feel bad. Then after the main character defeats all the gangsters then he saves the girlfriend and makes mee feel good again. why am i allowing my happiness to be dictated by a fictional world created by some dude in an office? It's so artificial and so fake. It's not a fulfilling thing. I realised my core value is comfort. But I realised that to be comfortable I had to first create conflict. And I realised, wait a minute, that doesn't even make any sense. There has to be something more.\n\nAt this point I felt so depressed... As I kept reading, I felt more and more depressed because I realised it was causing me so much conflict. yet I kept reading.\n\nStep 4: but then for some reason, something clicked. I put down the comic book. And I suddenly had a strong urge to do logical things. And I felt so good doing it. I felt so much better than reading some shitty comic books. I was learning, I was growing. I love logic. I want to keep doing logical things. It makes me feel so happy. After putting down the comic book and experiencing this click, I went back to the computers and started reading more about physics, about critical thinking, about logic, about fitness, about diet. I wanted everything. I wanted to understand everything logically.\n\nthanks for reading!","createdAt":1480219733,"score":7,"author":"yordleathene","id":"5f3iqz"},{"title":"i feel like i collapsed in the inside","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5f2d0j/i_feel_like_i_collapsed_in_the_inside/","selftext":"I've been trying step 3, but really struggling with my current core value, rellay dont know if it is comfort or validation seeking some things i do feels like comfort, like procrastination of every thing like diet, driving lincense, School and etc...\nBut others feel from validation, like trying to be the center of attention, trying to be a cs pro player, or just the best at anything, but that can come from comfort too right ?

At the time, of course, I was not aware of the core value mechanic.\n\n\nSoon enough, it became quite clear that four-step process actually solves the fundamental problem by correcting it at the root cause level. \nThis seemed very much the same process as solving any sort of bug in code. And thus, it appealed to my rational part of the brain. \nThe emotional side, which I never fully acknowledged before, was not that cooperative, to say the least.\n\n\nThere were two key moments or phases for me for Step 3. Metaphorically, the first phase was the discovery of the key and the second phase was unlocking the door.\n\n### Phase One ###\n\nLeading up to this phase, I tried many things. The things to highlight were:\n\n* Consuming the [content for helping you appreciate logic](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Content_to_help_you_appreciate_logic).\n* Going through all the episodes of [Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Spacetime_Odyssey) and emotionally connecting to them. There were moments that tears were falling from my eyes.\n* Riccardo's talk on the last episode of Cosmos sparked me to rewatch the last episode gain. Though I noticed that the emotional intensity was lessened.\n* [Rafael's translation of Christians](https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5crdkt/how_i_started_trusting_in_logic/) introduced some useful phrases which could be used as some sort of mantra.\n\n\nThe thing that starting giving me progress in tackling my core value was writing. \n\n&gt; \"Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is\" —Guindon\n\nWriting down past events, drilling down on the reasons for my chosen actions at the time, and uncovering that they were related to my core value was the catalyst I needed to \nconnect heavy dissonance with comfort in Step 3. \nThis occurred on Nov. 19th and another tool to be able to achieve this breakthrough was acquired from [Podcast #46, Think For Yourself](https://soundcloud.com/athenepodcast/tracks).\nI first began writing out the insights in the first half of that episode in my own words and began truly thinking about it on whether it made sense or not. \nThis will take some time, but it is worth it.\nThen I applied this level of thinking on my past asking \"why\" questions and pausing to feel whether I was emotionally being affected. \nOnce I had found a weak point, I drilled down on it by flooding my inner child with more examples from the past that I knew comfort held me back. I could really feel in my heart\narea a deep pressure that I can associate with a breaking of some sort of emotional attachment that you heavily identified with. \nMy eyes were watering at this point which I took as another good indicator of progress. \nAt this point, I left my desk to sit on the coach to really focus in on this negative feeling reiterating on each example in my past.\nThe intensity plateaued at a certain point, but I was still going on keeping the negativity for a while just in case I did not reach the right intensity point.\n\n\nThen, without really realizing it, I made a connection. There was one really good friend I had known from undergrad that came into my mind and the following flooded my mind:\n\n* This friend that I knew was someone who had a very strong passion for Mathematics and Physics.\n* He wanted to prove and understand everything for himself. \n* In some regards, he was quite ahead of most students in the university program I was in. \n* And, he was quite advanced because of his drive for logic.\n\n\nI was shocked as I found the key into making the needed leap of fate for logic. I was so surprised that this key was in me all this time and I never knew it. I then envisioned logic as a very close long-lost forgotten friend that I just met in a very long while.\nI was choking at intense joy with eyes watering. I then promoted this embodiment of logic to a higher level being, and finally realizing that it was really just me. I was logic.\n\n\nAt the time I was making this connection, I observed the following:\n\n* My hands, which were held together, started feeling an immense tingling sensation and that feeling started to propagate to my arms and legs to a lesser degree. \n* Blood rushed into my head and my body started truly feeling the cold air in my room. (I did not realize that I did not have the heat on until then). \n* The room all the sudden was noticeably brighter as if someone had just turned on the dim lights I had onto an even brighter setting.\n* As my vision came to focus, everything seemed clearer, and my thoughts were in complete silence.\n* Any pressure in my head dissipated completely.\n\n\nThe intense joy lasted a few moments, and as I calmed down, I truly felt the silence in my apartment still with a mild tingling sensation throughout the body. \nThis sensation did not last long. I began wondering whether I had experienced the click. I had an urge to begin doing something productive that made sense. \nI accepted the uncertainty that this was a placebo and just operated under the assumption that I had indeed clicked and began going through the [guide for people that clicked](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Guide_for_people_that_clicked).\n\n### In-between Phases ###\n\nI tried writing everything on that guide with my own words in my notebook and pondering on whether it made sense, and talked to myself aloud seeing if I could explain it properly. This process actually helped a lot to truly understand the insights contained in the guide.\n\nWhen I got to the fact that the human brain consists of a 100 billion neurons, I wanted to find where that fact came from. I found a source that contradicted this stating \nthe human brain was on average [86 billion neurons](http://www.suzanaherculanohouzel.com/azevedo-et-al-2009-j-comp-neur/). I started seeing the power of thinking for yourself.\n\n\nEventually, I reach the section about having control over your thoughts and emotions. I began to understand that insight and how powerful it was. \nI went to bed at around 11:30 PM and set an alarm for 7:00 AM. The next morning as soon as the alarm sounded, I immediately woke up and started on my morning routine without any effort. Before, I would have had eight different alarms set across an hour or two for the time I wanted to wake up and always struggled to get up. \nI was surprised by how easy this was.\n\n\nI continued through the morning by going through the guide. The section titled [\"Step-by-step process on how to deal with the dissonance\"](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Guide_for_people_that_clicked#6.29.C2.A0.C2.A0.C2.A0_Step-by-step_process_on_how_to_deal_with_the_dissonance) was an important insight that actually helped me achieve a much more\nintense emotional experience which brings me on to phase two.\n\n### Phase Two ###\n\nEventually, my mom called me and we talked for an hour. That conversation had generated considerable inner conflict. I was talking to her about how I could perhaps eventually want \nto do something on my own and not work for anyone. Both saying that and her response generated quite a bit of inner conflict within me. \nI was not sure what I was going to do and I had doubts on whether I clicked or not.\nRight after the call, I employed the step-by-step process on how to deal with the dissonance. \nI captured everything in my notebook about this process. This may help for those that get into a similar situation. I captured the following:\n\n\nMy feelings after the call: \n\n* Some inner pain, a feeling of uncertainty, confusion, of something wrong, it feels like fear\n\n\nSome thoughts that appear are:\n\n* \"You are not good enough!\"\n* \"You are fooling yourself, quitting your job is insane, you would struggle to do anything. You would ruin your career.\"\n* \"You do not know what you are doing.\"\n* \"You will fail.\"\n\n\nI then started debunking why I was feeling this way:\n\n\n\"It is because I am afraid of the change that will be caused if I change jobs. It is just my core value getting simulated even though safety in comfort is flawed. Logic gives and provides for more safety than what my old value could ever provide. Because with logic, I can rely on myself. My-fucking-self. Not anyone, but myself.\"\n\n\nAlso, my mom during the call had given examples in the past were starting your own business was caused issues for my family members such as my father, uncle, and my grandparents. \nI began debunking this as that was causing me quite of bit of dissonance. \nEffectively, fear was being instilled in me, which would definitely hold me back and trap me in a comfort bubble. \n\n\nBut, as I was writing my thoughts, I noticed a shift within. A shift towards a warm feeling that logic was really there for me. \nMemories of my friend as being the key to the puzzle entered into my working memory.\n\n\nThis resulted in receiving a burst of euphoria that was much more intense than I had felt before. \nMy hands were tingling and that sensation spread throughout my hands to my arms, head, and legs. \nIt was a truly emotional experience and I knew at the moment that I wanted to capture this on camera just in case it would be useful later on. \nVery interestingly, seeing my own image in this state on the screen had resulted in positive feedback loop. \nThis is because when I repeatedly saw myself in this state on my laptop, I would realize that indeed this is occurring for real.\nThat had further triggered an even larger wave of happiness and excitement. This had repeated in cycles for some time. \nThis effect could be connected with mirror neurons in the brain and seems like an interesting mechanic.\n\nTo summarize the possible effect:\n\n&gt; Seeing yourself experience an emotion could possibly cause an amplification and extension of the experienced emotion.\n\nThis experience continued on for 55 minutes until the effect had subsided. During capturing myself in this clip, I was talking aloud which seemed to really help and contribute to the experience. I have this footage available to share if it would be of any positive value. \n\n\nOne interesting related tangent that I experienced today:\n\n\nBefore the click, I had always hated how my voice sounded and how I looked on video for many different reasons, some of which I am actively solving post-click.\nToday, when I played back one or two recent videos of myself, I no longer experience that immediate reaction of despising my image. \nInstead, I felt as if I look at the video as an outsider would. \nI have experienced similar phenomena in the last few days. Mainly, people around me are are beginning to feel a part of me. \nIn the past, I would experience some anxiety when I came into unexpected situations that had the chance of speaking with some stranger.\nThat is no longer is the case. Instead, the people I walk past by, for example on the street, seem different and then they ever did before as if we were connected at some level.\nI would attribute this to really absorbing the insights in the guide, applying the steps of dealing with unwanted thoughts and emotions from your previous core value, and reflecting what you really are.\n\n\n### After Math ###\n\nHere are some of the other things I have experience post-click:\n\n* My sleep pattern was immediately fixed:\n  * Before, waking up was painful, involved many alarms, and could take half an hour to an hour after the first alarm.\n  * After, I am consistently going to bed just before midnight and waking up at 7:00 AM with little effort.\n* Working out becomes quite easy:\n  * Before. I was not working out and never really wanted to.\n  * On Sunday, I felt the urge to go the gym and just run as it seemed it would give me the highest EV at the moment.\n  * This continued throughout the week of going to the gym and working on cardio.\n  * I immediately see the value pay off, this is insane.\n* Eating habits have been corrected:\n  * Several weeks before the click, I stopped eating meat. As a consequence, I started losing weight because I typically missed meals and meat was compensating it.\n  * Now, I am eating much more consistently and enough. And, I can see that my weight is getting corrected.\n* Interestingly, I do not mind cold water when I enter showers whereas before I would naturally retract at the touch of cold as it was uncomfortable.\n* Distractions and entertainment have gone. I do not even need to listen to music to stay concentrated anymore, it just flows naturally.\n* My emotional intelligence is notable increased. I am much more aware of my emotions. This was important when dealing with remnants of the past.\n* I feel dissonance when I encounter things that do not make sense and strive to find out why without much effort.\n* There are several little improvements I have been making to my daily workflow to improve my efficiency. Little things that add up. e.g. my morning routine is faster leaving me an extra half an hour.\n* I now think in terms of what will give the highest EV at the moment. Reflecting on before the click, it seems quite blind to go on life without such a mindset.\n\n\nThere were some of the major setbacks that I had to solve during the first few days. Here are some described:\n\n* I experienced inner conflict during the days I went to work this week. The dissonance was being triggered for various reasons, mostly the following:\n  * My work environment had many things that triggered my past, so I had to solve unwanted emotions produced by existing neural connections from the past. This actually increased my trust in logic over time especially and I quickly remembered not to identify with it.\n  * As my awareness expanded, the illogical behaviors that others in my environment were somewhat becoming a part of me. I was actively looking for solutions how I could solve these issues of those around me because that would actually be a higher expected value. This was a very interesting realization for me.\n* Being curious about the attention the recently-released documentary had lead me into reading several negative comments. This triggered emotions within that posed some challenges to solve, but I was able to solve them eventually by critical thinking about the concerns I had.\n\nEmotional intelligence is quite important when dealing with such setbacks. Meditation from experience has been a great tool in the regard during this past few days.\n\nAt this stage, I have mostly finished with the click guide and will continue on restructuring my belief system and building my trust with logic even further. I am very thankful to see the tremendous improvements this as resulted in such a little time period. I have begun to realize the importance that the environment you are in has in the most real sense.","createdAt":1480136361,"score":17,"author":"AbstractFour","id":"5exvea"},{"title":"Going up and down all the time","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5eyr23/going_up_and_down_all_the_time/","selftext":"I clicked about a month ago now, but I keep \"loosing the grip of it\", when this happens I get back the urges to waste my time on comfortable things like games and movies.

What worked for me was connetcing logic to a rendeer/horse toy moving around and looked fun to me and my inner child. When my inner child decided to let go teddy bear and jump on this rendeer (sounds funny i know :D) i felt like i was loosing consiusnous for a second or so and felt im gonna fall back on my sofa where i was sittng with closed eyes and trying to click. I fell clear mind after that, not much dopamine rush (maybe becouse of supressing emotions whole my life) but it was nice feeling - happines\n- questioning if that realy happend and if im gonna loose it by night  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nStep 4:\n- earlier i started to work out while listening to Athenes podcast/twitch stream, and drinking water instead of soda – now it comes naturaly, with no discipline and not feeling guilty if i take a day for rest or so cos it makes sense\n- what i think is logical – thats what i do and its not like im changing my whole life drasticly (like im eating meet whole my life and today im pure vege – it makes sense to go that direction but not with hudge jump, i see it as a proces that started). Im restructuring it slowly but surely, adding healthier food into my diet, resigning for loads of sugar i ate etc. Im no judging peaple as i did earlier and if i do im consious about it, racionalise what drives them and how their actions makes sense to them. I sometimes catch myself that someone \"hurt my feelings\" by saying i made a mistake but quickly i think about it, feel gratefull to this person, change my thinking and behaviour in the future and feel more happy that im upgrading myself every day with every mistake i made – it was a big issue earlier also connected to my core value\n- biggest fear now is to loose it but im still in flow for about 5 days so im optimistic about it and not thinking of it like placebo or so anymore  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThank you very much Athene and Crew (esspecialy Stas by reddit posts and Ricardo with testimony on the stream).

Never have i really heard someones words and totally, without a doubt trust them. I would always have second doubts about what they said.\n\nI remember when i had asked one of my relatives who was religious on how do i trust God. I could never really understand how i could just trust a figure like this. If i was asked about this, i would never tell anything, i would probably lie and tell i did believe in God, but i had a subconsious feeling that i didn't trust anyone.\n\nAs much as i heard, i could never really trust anyone in early age, which is probably why i somehow, on a VERY deep level, i trusted my own reasoning. I never was very smart or intelligent, but i just did as my gut told me to. I never wanted to trust anyone else, since most of the time i would see that they are full of shit. Almost all of my life was built on lies to others, so i could make compromises.\n\nThese lies kept on going as i grew more and had to take more responsibilities. Without any knowledge i started to get social conditioning and my actions were starting to be oriented towards other people, comfort, safety. Yet still, in most cases i never really felt like any of these social interaction like parties or drinking were any good. That all the people around me didn't know what they were doing.\n\nI always felt dissonance when doing illogical things. I tried to do them and have fun with people, yet it always just struck unfulfilling. I felt more like a grown up that had to be part of child games that had no meaning.\n\nThe problem was, that even as a grown up, i had no background of success and therefore no power. I could not influence other people because i couldn't understand how things worked.\n\nAfter finding Athene and understanding what he did for the world and the charity, i always felt like this was fulfilling and the right thing to do. Listening to him i wanted to understand the world even more. \n\nProblem was i never was truly emotionally attached to logic or reasoning. I always tried to do things with reason, yet i could not make it effectively. I oriented myself to power and safety.\n\nEndlessly i thought of how i could change the world and influence others, but as things went by i understood that i needed that power and safety so i could save myself from this social environment and help others understand what bullshit the world offers.\n\nI read the book \"The power of now\" which had a very good effect on me, that i could not be in my head and actually control my thoughts a lot better. Yet it did not help me enough to cure this dissonance i had sometimes.\n\nOnly after Athene talking about \"the click\" on how i should invest myself emotionally on it, did i understand that my \"heroes\" path to save others is not so well thought. \n\nIn heroes path i would sacrifice myself for others, since i would understand **why** they acted the way they did, that it is not people fault. Everyone is born with the intent to do good, but is conditioned to be selfish or twisted in some way.\n\nTrust in logic made me understand that i was weak and clingy on safety and power. I wanted to save people to redeem myself in a way. \n\nNow i get it that i can make a bigger impact with this. With the right environment i can grow more than i did over the past years. Because most of the time i have to fight with the social conditioning and unresourcefully try to basically *survive* this and keep myself intact.\n\nI understand that my guts feeling to do good was always within my reasoning from young age except i didn't have the knowledge how to do it effectively. Now i understand more and can do things more inline with logic. I have always felt that people need to understand this feeling, and i can now define it.\n\n**TL;DR:** My childhood core was in the right path of reason, it didn't really had the knowledge to understand how to do it. It clinged more to safety and power, but it always tried to not hurt others in the process. Now i remember as i have shifted from that, that my most **inner** core always tried to do what is right, but in a wrong way, by sacrificing myself and always being the *victim*.

(ex-crew)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5etlvy/my_click_after_almost_2_months_excrew/","selftext":"(sorry for wall of text)\n\nHello there. I'm 21yrs old and from Belgium. I joined the \"Athene crew\" this august. I clicked after \"trying\" for about 1.5months and wanted to share some insights here. \nThis post is mostly focused on overcoming mental layers that you might have with step 3. \n\n Tldr backstory: I had comfort core value and was too comfortable in the group. This prevented me from making progress clicking, so it seemed most logic to go home and not return until I clicked.\n\n\n\n\n**STEP 2:** \nI understood my core value to be comfort quite early on, before there was even such a thing as the 4 steps. This understanding was more rational than emotional. It was quite different for me to really connect to this emotionally.\nI really got step 2 into my awareness by using imagination. I imagined me being in certain life situation, which was represented by a room. Comfort would mean that I would be very satisfied as long as everything was provided by the room. The issue comes when you place an better room next to it. Comfort makes you cling to a situation you are familiar with. You are not motivated to seek anything else, even if you understand it's better for you.\nWhat also helped was realizing that my inaction (because of comfort) is responsible for many people suffering a lot. I imagined a large crowd watching me hopefully to help them, but I was too comfortable in my little bubble so I didn't want to help.\nThis emotional understanding was very important in making progress for step 3.\n\n\n\n**STEP 1:**\n This one was surprisingly hard for me. I considered myself a very rational person, yet didn't feel like logic was very safe/trustworthy. I watched all the content on the wiki, but still it didn't really sink in.\nWhat made me really connect to logic was analyzing my past. I looked at all the positive memories I had, and tried to spot what made certain experiences enjoyable. Going to the crew was a very positive thing in my life, without a doubt the best life-decision I've made. After thinking critically and debating myself for some time, I was able to connect all those positive memories to me valuing logic. If anything, comfort/fitting in was going against those positive memories.\nAfter going through this process, I felt a very deep connection to logic. I went outside for a walk in the forest and I could see the patterns in the leaves and trees. Although this brought immense joy, comfort was still very strong in me.\n\n\n\n**STEP 3:** \nBy far the hardest step for me was connecting a negative emotion to my core value. The reason for this was a lack of emotional intelligence. Throughout my childhood I was always very inward, and hesitant to show emotions to others. When I experienced emotions, I would suppress them and seek distraction. This pattern was very deeply engrained and I still feel the tendencies even after clicking. A couple of things helped me connect to my emotions (listed in order):\n\n* Loving/kindness meditation (for those interested):\nThis meditation is one where you channel positive emotions towards yourself, a friend, other people. This was an eye-opener for me because I was really aware of the emotions. Before this, emotions were obviously there, but I would only recognize them when they were very very strong.\n\n* Framing conflicting ideas as \"just a thing I do because I want to click\"\nThis was by far the most important layer for me to understand and push through. I would subconsciously, emotionally, believe that I was just playing pretend. It might sounds strange, but I rationally believed I was really fucking myself over by holding onto comfort, and at the same time I would not feel any negative emotions at all towards the comfort.\nI framed all my efforts to click in a way that is similar to how an actor would speak in a film. He can go into his script and act really well, but deep inside he knows the situation isn't real at all.\nRafael's post (https://goo.gl/gK30wQ) pointed me in the right direction for this. \n\nThe way I broke through this layering, is not through reason. I understood it was an emotional process, so I looked for ways to go about it emotionally. Here's what I did:\n\n* I would think about a short sentence and see how I responded. e.g. 'comfort is what caused all the procrastination in your life'.\n\n* I tried to be really open-minded and catch myself putting up the frameworks. After a while a pattern became clear. It was as if my inner child would put the thoughts inside a safe bubble, where they couldn't touch the child. Inside the bubble I could reason all I wanted, as long as I didn't come too close to the core.\n\n* The hardest part was finding a way to break through the bubble. What worked for me was \"sweeping\" the framework aside, as if you considered the option but declined. I would tell my inner child \"no, this thing you are doing is NOT ok\". Saying/doing this once didn't do much. It took many attempts and a lot of energy to learn how to get rid of the framework.\nAfter learning this mechanic, I was able to go very deep at basically any point in the day. It still took me about 10days to click after this.\n\t\n* When really confronting the core, I would be very easily distracted.\nUsually I am quite able to focus and think clearly, but when focusing on my core value this was different. My mind would wander to random topics much quicker than usual. The thoughts never stopped, but I managed to reduce the frequency by becoming aware of the mechanic.\n\t\t\n* The final layer - being too harsh/tense &amp; confidence\nI had just read hateramos’ comment on a thread (https://goo.gl/SsvXtX) :\n&gt; I think you will probably have an easy time clicking, if you can bring all those emotions to the surface. But don't rush through it. Do each step on your own time, build a good emotional connection with logic first, find your core value and only then you go to bed and while in a very relaxed state, you go through your life, you connect negative genuine emotions towards your current core value and you cling on to logic, because it will provide you more safety. It's the realization that your current core value doesn't give you as much safety as logic, on an emotional level. Make sure you complete step 1 and 2, take your time, no need to rush. Good luck mate\n\n\tEspecially the phrase “you will probably have an easy time clicking” and “relaxed state” where very powerful to me.\n\t\tBecause of all my attempts failing, my self-esteem became lower and lower. I was starting to accept my old life, even though I didn't really want it. The phrase “you will probably have an easy time clicking” was really powerful to me, because I knew he meant what he said. \n\t\tThe last hurdle for me was being relaxed while at the same time experiencing the negative emotions. I had tried this before, but the layers described above were preventing me from really doing this.\n\t\tI noticed that I would be distracted emotionally when trying to connect the emotions to my core value. I would try to focus on the emotion, but I “slipped off” because it was too painful. My attention was repelled like when you try to put two positive magnets together. At this point, I had already seen a lot of layers, so it was much easier to overcome the mechanic.\n\t\t\n**THE CLICK:**\nI began by bringing up the negative emotions I had, without linking them to comfort. I tried to be very non-judgmental, very relaxed. \nAfter about 5-10mins of doing this, I proceeded by gently moving my attention &amp; these emotions towards comfort. I felt the urge to \"slip-off\", but didn't give in. I recognized the urge very calmly, acknowledged it, declined, and then proceeded by going over the negative emotion once again.\n\t\t\nNext, I focused on the things science has brought for society, and connected this positive emotion to logic. \nI went back and forth between dissonance and resonance a couple of times, every time holding onto the negative emotions longer.\nAfter about 3-4times, I felt a sweeping motion going through my body. My mind became much clearer, as if I had bad vision and put on a pair of glasses. My background state was clearly different. I felt an immense joy, and when I accessed my core again, it didn't hurt anymore.\nAt this point I was still skeptical because I had had many different placebo experiences. I had believed at least 3 times that \"this was it, this is different\", so I proceeded very cautiously.\n\t\n\t\n**STEP 4:**\nAbout 2hours after clicking, I had a class in university scheduled and decided to go because I was unsure whether it was the real deal (despite having debated really in depth for an hour).\nDuring the lecture, I had existential questions come up but there was too much noise &amp; distraction to answer them. The dissonance grew, I tried to stop it by telling myself everything does make sense and I just need time, but it was not enough. At this point I unclicked and I fell back into the dull background state I was in before the click. I experienced extreme anxiety and disgust, but I was able to suppress pretty well so people around me didn’t freak out.\nWhen things got a little bit more quiet (5mins later), I managed to re-click by solving my question and going through the same process of dissonance and resonance I had done before.\n\t \nThis unclick-reclick happened again later that day, but the disconnect from logic was less severe. This time it was because I fell into my old habits of distracting and deflecting emotions instead of trying to resolve the dissonance.\n\t\nI realized later on the day that debating myself was the best way of resolving the inner conflict. Just telling myself everything makes sense is not enough. Deep understanding is what builds real trust. Thinking slower and talking to the inner child is helping a lot right now to build up my trust.\n\nThe future still looks slightly scary, but I am motivated by my previous successes and the positive emotion I will feel afterwards. My faith in logic is still in its infancy, but I expect this to improve with time. The previous click-reclick experiences give me confidence that I will be able to do the necessary work regardless of what happens. \n\n\n**Conclusion: **\nI firmly believe that as long as you rationally want it, and experience any conflict, you can do it. You can use discipline/motivation to keep you on track, to keep you focused on your goal.\nWhat is holding you back is the mental constructs, not the \"you don't really want it\" narrative. Same goes for \"it's too hard\". Clicking itself is really easy, breaking through the layers is hard if you have lower emotional intelligence.","createdAt":1480081143,"score":4,"author":"CrYofFuN","id":"5etlvy"},{"title":"My experience with the click so far","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5epuy3/my_experience_with_the_click_so_far/","selftext":"Hello,\nI am 18 years old and from Germany.\nMy old core value was comfort.\n As i was never realy happy about my lifesituation i found the click as a oportunity to improve it.

I study computer engineering at university. Today in the afternoon I sat down on my sofa ready to make the click.\n\nHow did I start it?\n\nBefore everything I have read the logicnation wiki to make sure how to proceed with the experience. Mind you I have been trying to do this for 2 weeks now. (Although I have never sat down for this long of a period.) After I sat down in a comfortable position I decided to do the two guided meditation for part 1 and part 2. \n\nPart 1:\n\nI have started loving logic when I was about 17 years old. Until that point I was your typical \"I hate math, this doesn't make any sense\" etc. kid. What really helped me here is watching Cosmos (2014) [This is really great], documentation about fractal geometry, and the Fibonacci sequence video. \n\nPart 2:\n\nNow this wasn't as easy as I thought it will be. I had doubts whether I had comfort as my core value or fitting in. What really helped me here is talking with my inner-child. I envisioned it like it's in the meditation guide. A child holding a teddy bear. What I did was the following: I went on a journey with him on \"our\" past. Everything I remembered from my childhood I brought it up to him, stopped the frame, and asked why did we do this? Each time he answered I got closer to the realization that my core value was comfort.\n\nPart 3:\n\nNow this was the hardest hands down. I continued talking with my inner child. I interrogated him about our past and what we achieved with it in the present. I showed him the flaws of the \"teddy bear\"(comfort) and how easily we could be greater if what he hold onto was logic instead. At one point I felt like almost shouting at my core value and really felt bad (I think it was the defense mechanism). Then I introduced another character to my inner child. Logic imagined as \"God\". I made God show him how crazy it is that we are alive and we exists. How beautiful life really is and how everything is connected to the beauty of our universe.\n\nAnd at that moment for a second all picture in my head was gone. Everything turned to black. The next thing I felt was sudden twitching in my brain and my body.  It was really frightening at first but after a few seconds as I opened my eyes I felt at ease and extreme happiness engulfed my body.\n\nNow I feel like I must do things that makes sense. I will wait a few days and see if it's real or placebo but I doubt the latter.

I did have a moment last month where i kind of did a 180 on games, and planned a rather logical path for my life where i could have the biggest positive impact on humanity, but that kind of faded away through the week. \n\nI dont know what to do. I just feel like i dont have a core value. I feel emotionless, so i guess its hard to be emotionally intelligent at this point. I do think however that comfort has been a core value throught my life, but i dont think it is anymore. I do have an unconditional trust in logic, and i love sience. I base my whole existence on being a rational being, but i cant seem to get my brain to act acordingly. I just feel completely powerless and worthless. And the feeling is reinforced by knowing what i have to to to make it better. So there you have it. I do feel better after typing it out.

What you can expect to read is what effects it had on my life so far. And what helps me the most.\n\nI'm trying to explain you how it went when I clicked also try to explain some important stuff. And i recommend you to read the four steps: [4STEPS](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Main_Page#Step_1:_Develop_an_unconditional_trust_in_logic)\n\n*1. Critical thinking.\n\n*2. Control over your emotions.\n\n*3. Realize that your current core value brings harm.\n\n*4. The changes since I've clicked.\n\n\n**1.** Let me explain my experiences with the click. After I made the click I tried to do things that were logical to me with my current understanding. Some people do not understand why this is important, it is because doing logical stuff is more in line with what you are. That means what we have been doing the past centuries is evolving we didn't just evolve for no reason. Humans have always tried to understand everything but inter-subjectivereality (ISR) has distracted us for some amount of time but with this core value you cant be distracted anymore because you are trying to understand everything and start critical thinking. With critical thinking you can try to understand alot of things but you need some knowledge. How did I use critical thinking. Critical thinking you actually can do with everything i'll give an example when Athene said \"you should come over because that is the most logical thing to do because you can spread the awareness here more efficient\" at that moment you try to understand and critical think about it. So the day that I clicked that night I was thinking for 2 hours in my bed I couldn't sleep because I was thinking that if there are more efficient ways to spread it (ofcourse you also have to come to the conclusion that spreading is the most efficient thing to do and that is up to you to figure that out) so when I was thinking about it I tried to have a better way to spread this awareness. And I came to the conclusion that I should start my own team like Athene and spread it from another community. But after half an hour I realized that if I join the crew I can do that aswell and I already have the people around me that have the right mindset. At that moment I realized that the most effective thing to do was joining the team/house. This is one of the examples I'm giving you guys to make it clear. \n\n**2.** So when I clicked I quit playing games and watching videos of people that play video games, for entertainment purposes. ([You can have control over your thoughts and emotions](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Guide_for_people_that_clicked#3.29.C2.A0.C2.A0.C2.A0_You_can_have_control_over_your_thoughts_and_emotions))But I still had the thoughts to play games but when I realized that the thoughts aren't mine they just pop up automatically. It is because your old core value isn't gone yet it's still there but with the fourth step you try to make your logical core value over rise the comfort one and how do you do that well actually just like all the years you've been doing comfortable stuff and when you play games you are happy you do the same with logic you keep doing logical stuff and at some point you don't have to think (well actually when your core value is logic you try to find what is most logical thing to do, not like you don't have to think anymore) about what is logical like the comfort one you just start up the pc impulsively and do the most comfortable stuff so how you can do that with logic just keep doing logic stuff what makes most sense. So I followed the [fourth step](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Main_Page#Step_4:_Keep_making_logical_decisions_to_strengthen_your_trust_in_logic) even when my friends asked to play games I just said no and tried to explain them about the click. I know for people that did not click this is going to sound like boring life but the reason you think that is because your core value is most likely comfort that means when you watch tv or play video games and relax your [reward center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system) gets stimulated that means you are happy at that moment. But when someone tries to get you out of your comfort zone like when your mom tells you to put the trash outside or when someone confronts you with your actions, you don't accept it or get pissed it's because you want to stay in your comfort bubble (I've also been through this because my core value was comfort) but this is all flawed. Because when your core value is logic and you do logical stuff you become happy aswell. It's very hard to understand this for an outsider I've been through it aswell. Because when your core value on an emotional level is logic and when you do logical stuff your [reward center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system) gets stimulated. That's why when you do something logical you become happy.\n\n**3.** What also helped me alot was the [thirth step](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Main_Page#Step_3:_Realize_that_your_current_core_value_doesn.27t_provide_as_much_safety_as_logic.C2.A0) this actually means that you look at your past and find the moments when your core value went against yourself or the environment. That means when you just wanted to stay comfortable you harm yourself or the environment aswell. Like with me I can try to give some examples. I rarely helped my mother with cleaning the house or making food since it went against my core value (comfort) because either I wanted to play games or I didn't do the things I did not like and the things I did not liked were the things that had a conflict with my core value. Since I've clicked I can make food with plessure or clean my room because it's logical to do those things.\n\n**4. The changes since I've clicked:**\n\n* Started to critical think and tried to understand everything\n* No validation seeking mindset\n* No need for attention\n* Can move my butt without problems\n* Clear minded\n* Smarter (What I've noticed this weak was that I prejudged no one I just try to understand the information they're telling me not how they say it or who is saying it. Before the click I couldn't explain people about somethings but I've noticed that I can just explain the click without problem maybe because I fully get it)\n\n**If there are any flawed ideas I'd love to hear it**\n","createdAt":1479925227,"score":11,"author":"Karay01","id":"5eiswa"},{"title":"Do I have to be a mathematician?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5egjs5/do_i_have_to_be_a_mathematician/","selftext":"I'm confused, should I actually know math or strive to be good at math to complete all the steps?\n\nI already have an \"unconditional\" trust in math and logic, that doesn't mean I understand the mathematical concepts that govern our reality.

These are things Athene said, although not always word for word.**  \n\"You make the click and you start thinking for yourself for the first time.\" (Didn't realize how true this was until after I clicked.)  \n\"Everyone submits their will to what gives them safety. Most submit to comfort.\"  \n\"You have to experience your current core value to be floored on an emotional level, because if you rationally decide that comfort is not good but you don't actually feel it then you won't be able to make the click, because emotionally you won't feel a real reason to do so. So you either need to already feel dissonance with your current core value OR you need to initiate dissonance by connecting to it by really reminding yourself how much you are lying to yourself, how much you don't own this sense of safety, how much it is temporary, you really have to find ways to connect negative emotions to this core value and you need to experience logic as love and warmth and meaningful. It shouldn't feel cold.\"  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Videos I watched right before the click:**  \n[Fibonacci Sequence in Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt2OlMAJj6o)  \n[Nature by Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGeOWYOFoA)  \n[The Cosmos scene that helped Ricardo click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fct1ph7VrdI)  \n[Is the Universe Entirely Mathematical?

I think partly because I had not slept well the night before. At this point I already thought I made sense because I listened to so many real talks, but in reality I only made sense in some areas by forcing some of Athene's ideas into my life. This forcing required a lot of discipline and constant tiresome searching for motivation to maintain. I noticed I was a bit egotistical about knowing all these insights from Athene's previous real talks and didn't want to let go. I only realized this after being brutally honest with myself, and it hurt, because I thought I had reached a point where I had overcome these childish problems. I even suspected this click thing was either intentionally being faked to recruit new people or that they were telling the truth, but their experience wasn't from clicking, it was from eating healthy and meditating etc. After a good nights sleep i decided to play with the idea that what they are saying could be true, listened to more stories, and trusted that it was legit. This click is a real phenomenon.  \n\nI remembered Katarina on the stream advised asking yourself why you do every single action that you do and after trying this, I realized my actions weren't making as much sense as I believed.   \nI then remembered Athene saying you have to initiate dissonance. I continued questioning every single action in my life, and the true origins of every thought. Asked myself what beliefs or core value created this thought, forcing honesty out of myself no matter how uncomfortable or confronting it was. I also scrutinized my future plans  like i did with the thoughts. Eventually I realized that my core value was comfort, and this was a big relief to figure out because i had been repressing it for a long time, I thought i made sense, and I would force making sense as much as possible in my life with Athene's real talk patch ups, but i did not emotionally value it.  \n\nPeople might want examples of actions that made me realize i didn't truly value making sense so here is one: if i hadn't slept well, for whatever reason, then i would tell myself my brain is not operating correctly so i might as well just do relaxing stuff until it works again. this was further reinforced by knowing that my sports betting results would suffer if i bet without sleeping enough. obviously this isn't logical, this is classic comfort seeking behavior (but it didn't give me dissonance because i valued comfort emotionally). Obviously this isn't logical behavior, because there are always things you can do when tired. You can still learn things and work on less important tasks. After clicking I found I could override fatigue entirely with dopamine rewards from logical tasks. This is not a small placebo effect either. This is a night and day physical feeling.\n\nKnowing i needed to feel bad to make this change, I intentionally started being very hard on myself and telling myself how worthless i am in valuing comfort with example after example from my own life, until i started to feel dissonance and actually felt sick to my stomach and a bit emotional and sad. Then i started to think about how much better logic would be. I started to embrace and trust it emotionally, picturing that it is the force driving everything that is good in the world, all human advancements. I started to feel excitement and then a strong feeling of power over my own body, like i was experiencing total control over my body and total clarity of mind. I then started to realize that thinking logically made me feel good and had a warm, almost vision-type-feeling (hard to describe) that thinking logically in my future life would intensify these strong feelings. I pictured myself mapping out my brain and thoughts logically. At this point i thought i had probably made the click, but wasn't sure, and as the day went on I became more and more sure of it. I had a few doubts along the way too, but I kept trusting in logic and noticed it strengthening and took time out to think about what is most logical to build up a logical framework, at which point the euphoria really intensified.  \n\nWhat also helped was an idea that spiritual experiences are probably hardwired into all of us, because it gives a big evolutionary advantage. It allows large groups of people to come together under common belief systems. It would've allowed tribes to unite together rather than killing each other. So it helps to know that a spiritual side exists in us all and that you can unlock it by allowing the experience to feel spiritual. I would even think wacky, spiritual, religious, type shit to myself like 'submitting to logic', and 'logic is our creator', 'logic is god', 'brings the universe together as one.' I got lost in it a bit. To sum up the initial click, it felt like 100% control over mind and body. It truly is the rewiring of the reward center from comfort to logic.  \n\nIt took me a while to read about step 4 in the logic wiki, this is essential reading. It got pretty overwhelming for a little while until i read step 4 and the rest of the wiki.\n\nIt was nice to look out in nature and realize that beauty is literally logical patterns. Appreciating the Fibonacci Sequence and fractals. Everything beautiful in nature and everything useful we have created are logical constructs. The click felt like a dopamine high mixed with emotional warmth and love and feeling one with the earth. A sense of purpose and belonging. It helped to look back on negative moments in my life and reflect on where negative stages in my life were manifested by comfort as a core value, where comfort took away my safety and how logic would've protected me in these instances. I forced myself to feel sickness and negative emotions toward comfort for what it had done to me.  \n\nSomething which quietened my noisy skeptical mind (allowing me to delve into my emotions and emotional mind where the click happens) was that artificial intelligence (a purely logic based machine) will likely tremendously surpass human intelligence at some point in the future.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Follow up notes / rough-quotes from Athene's Real Talks that helped me stay clicked:**  \nFiguring out what is most logical to do is the first thing you should do after you click  \nAfter you make the click, do everything logical. if you don't do things logical you will experience insane dissonance. you have to always wonder what is the most logical thing i can do and if you always do that you will feel dopamine in the now.  \nAnd try to understand that when you experience dissonance it's because something is illogical.  \nIf you get dissonance it's because you don't understand something so you need to think about it logically until you understand it and the dissonance fades.  \nYou need to feed your faith in logic by doing logical stuff and structuring your life.  \nCertain beliefs might pop up from the past questioning your faith in logic, but the more you do logical stuff and realize it is working the more you will feed your faith in logic.  \nStrengthen that faith in logic over time.  \nThe euphoric state lasts for up to 3 days in most people. But you still feel great, you still feel rewarded for doing logical stuff.  \nEveryone at the house that clicked spent like 3 days in their room figuring stuff out. Start spreading it only once you're stable in yourself.  \nPeople can make the click and still do stuff that is illogical, but when they do that stuff it'll cause immense dissonance and if they keep doing it in spite of the dissonance then they will unclick because of the dissonance.","createdAt":1479821815,"score":9,"author":"menziessam","id":"5eaqhs"},{"title":"Questions for people that \"clicked\"","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5ecnt2/questions_for_people_that_clicked/","selftext":"I'm very confused about this, logic as a core value what does that even mean ?

I’m sorry if you guys take this for intellectual masturbation, please read it before deleting it. I’m writing this because I think it may bring people closer to adopting these ideas – it already did for me. I have not clicked (yet?))\n\n\nI wanted to make this post because I think it puts attention to an important occurrence in the call between Athene and Destiny, that revealed a very potent argument for the superiority of “logic” (I use “logic” here as defined by this community). This superiority stems from logic’s uncompromising consequentiality and its categorical rejection of moral absolutes. Let me explain.\n\n\nDuring the call the issue of consequentialism was raised on the topic of the rationality of lying to people. Athene posed the argument that lying about things for consequentialist reasons is logically and rationally justified. The example he used was that of water fasting, and his stance on denying the benefits of water fasting should he be asked about it on stream. He argues, that it is rational and justified, even if he himself is aware of potential benefits. The argument he gave for this position was that on the basis of the cautionary principle the potential negative effects of people water fasting in a wrong way (possibly killing themselves) outweigh the potential positive effects of people doing it in the right way.\n\n\nDestiny responded to this with two (inconsistent) arguments: an absolute deontological argument of an imperative to truth on the topic of ideas and ideology, and a relative deontological argument of an imperative to truth should lives be not directly affected by it. \n\n\nAthene actually debunked both of these arguments, although both Destiny and Athene seemed to afterwards lose the point and started arguing over semantics of what Destiny may or may not have said. The first one was debunked by Athene raising the issue of a group of people asking Destiny if they should adopt Nazism or Democracy, adopting the first one should he tell the truth and the latter should he lie – exactly a situation where Destiny’s first argument would rule out lying. Destiny had no counter argument to this at all, and flat out rejected the premise without providing reason.\n\n\nThe second one was debunked by Athene in its inconsistency, arguing that indirectly affecting lives is not categorically different from directly affecting them. He did so by asking Destiny if he would advocate potentially harmful actions on stream, knowing that they may kill people. In response Destiny in a subjectively moral argument alleged that he would not feel, and not be, responsible should people, “out of their own ignorance”, die because of it. This, understandably, seemed to perplex Athene, probably because a subjective counterargument to this claim is so blatantly obvious that it barely requires to be stated (For the sake of completeness: Person Z tells Destiny’s mom; wife; child; close friend, that doing action X will result in positive outcome y. Instead action x results in the death of any of the former. Destiny, if consistent, would have to blame this on the ignorance of his loved one, and not hold any blame to the Person Z. You really think he, or anyone for that matter, would do so?).\nBut this is not the important argument here. Look at Destiny’s claim of a more analytical level. What is he really saying, and what does his morality imply?\n\n\nHe claims that he is not responsible for the action of another, given that action is the result of a previous action of his, as long as he had neither the intent to cause it nor reasonably should have expected it to be caused. His moral basis for responsibility is thus intent (he wanted) or negligence (he should have known). His moral basis is consequently to his argument void of any connection to source/cause (he did) nor outcome/effect (it resulted in).\n\n\nUnsurprisingly given his rather ridiculous defense of the Electoral College and its democratic flaws, Destiny’s moral basis is here equivalent to what is the premise of guilt in institutionalized law. He equates moral duty and responsibility to legal duty and responsibility – which, for anyone accustomed to even basics of the philosophy of law, is strikingly ignorant. Similarly to his other arguments, Destiny’s reasoning seems to be entrapped in systemic, cultural conditioning. \n\n\nAs a moral principle to guide action and decision making, Destiny’s approach is completely dysfunctional. Divorced of cause and effect, actions are deemed moral and rational even if they have the most disastrous consequences as long as these consequences are not intended or reasonably to expect. As long as person X is not aware of the toxicity of Y, he is assumed rational in consuming Y, and has no moral responsibility for giving Y to his children. As long as person X believes that torturing her gay son so God may have mercy on him is the best she can do to him, she is rationally justified doing so and has no moral responsibility for the damage she causes. As long as person X believes that killing person Y is the right thing to do because X assumes Y to be a demonic ghost, he is reasonable doing so and has no moral duty towards Y’s life.\nYou may say these examples are absurd, and they are – as absurd as the proposition put forward by Destiny.\n\n\nThis is where logic truly shines through. Basing the reasoning of your actions on the consequences as to your available knowledge, and doing so void of any absolutes, is not just the morally superior, but also the rationally, logically superior thing to do. Logic has no absolutes. Not even logic itself is absolute. It is a self-refining system, refined with every new information you add to your knowledge. Logic as your guiding principle will make you crave rationality and morality, and on a meta-level a drive to advance the principle itself.\n","createdAt":1479769594,"score":9,"author":"Stadics","id":"5e787u"},{"title":"Trouble","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5e8s7l/trouble/","selftext":"I am very skeptical, but after listening to the call with Destiny I decided to try to understand it.

I believe I am now at a point, at least rationally speaking, where I can say that this is the most important thing I can spend my time on right now. So that is what I'm trying to do now.\n\nFor about a week now I have been putting in more time and trying harder. I also tried to organize myself better. So I started focusing on step 1 as positive emotions towards logic were still sparse. I watched and read some of the recommended content on the wiki and my appreciation towards logic grew steadily. But the thing that helped me the most I would say is the talk about step 1 from Ricardo about a week ago. Listening to that and later thinking more about how all your senses are brought about logic and how complex their workings are made me realize how rarely I appreciated them and if I did how amazing it felt trying to understand how they work. I assume this is what step 1 is about. Although my appreciation for logic is already there I don't know whether I am already ready to move on to step 2. When I try to think about logic I now have positive emotions towards it which I didn't used to have. Maybe I'm also just overthinking it at this point and should actually try to get actively work on step 2\n\nStep 2 is similar for me. I think the underlying reason, my core value, for most of my actions is comfort. I not only have a concept for it but if I try hard enough I also can evoke the emotion that is attached to this concept. Yet its still quite hard reaching this deep. In many of my daily actions I hardly think about the reason why I'm doing what I'm doing. The real cause is hidden beneath multiple layers of artificially and flawed ideas and concepts that I have built for myself so that I don't have to be honest about it.\n\nWhy I am asking this is because I already made all the steps but maybe not precise enough because I think I was already very close to making the click but then I got really anxious and I didn't have the courage to keep going. So that is why I thought that I maybe wasn't \"ready\" yet I needed to go through all steps again but just more thoroughly. I can remember that Athene once mentioned that you have to go through the steps chronologically and not skip something else you might risk that you ruin on opportunity/path on how to make the click and your current core value learns how to \"defend\" itself against that process. Maybe that is whats happening. That is probably also source of some of my anxiety. I am afraid that I mess something up if I try to make the click already instead of working on the steps.\n\nI have this concept in my head that the process of clicking itself is somewhat separate from the steps and that I have to first go through each step individually and then actively try to make the click thinking about everything I have learned as I was going through the steps. I am not sure if this concept is accurate though and whether I try to do it differently or just try harder the way I do it already. \n\nI'm am trying to force it but that only makes it harder to click. I realize that but I don't know how to stop myself from doing it. Every time I get close to it and feel some euphoria I try to chase that emotion and therefore  my attention gets derailed completely. It feels like I'm just trying to click for the sake of it and not for what it stands for which is truly understanding and appreciating logic on a fundamentally level I believe...\n\nI know this sounds all very confusing and might even seem like I'm trying to over complicate everything with it but this is just how I experience and think about it so far.\n\nBut who knows, maybe im just making excuses here. I wouldn't be surprised about it that then I'd still would appreciate some help because I'm struggling figuring it out myself. I don't think I need more dissonance but genuinely advice on how to keep going if my own method is flawed.\n\n////////////////\n\nOn a different note: there are two different \"voices\" in my head. The one who tells me what I want to do (mainly comfort driven). It seeks for instant gratification, avoids a lot of social situations and is mainly short sighted. Then there is the \"voice\" that tells me what I should do. (more logic oriented but subconsciously probably still somewhat under the influence of comfort). The actions it advocates are usually more oriented towards long term benefits like taking care of my mind and body or being more selfless. Sometimes I can take the perspective of an extern observer of these voices. The source of a lot of my dissonance comes from when I realize that I am listening to the first, short sighted voice and act according to it. This dissonance can be removed when I act according the the second, more aware voice. This would result in actions like eating healthy, working out, meditating and also trying to make the click (going through the steps).\n\nThis is what I think is when Athene is referring to \"patching your problems up with logic\". I believe on the one hand I am improving my chance of clicking when I put my body and mind in a healthier state but on the other hand I am also removing all the dissonance which is required for me to click as far as I understand. So I am not sure what to do exactly about that. I am sort of just creating a different kind of comfort bubble. I think maybe I just need conformation that there can be a different source of dissonance aswell so that I can draw it from there.","createdAt":1479737832,"score":4,"author":"nogxx","id":"5e482v"},{"title":"My Click/Unclick/Reclick journey (1 month total)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5e13o0/my_clickunclickreclick_journey_1_month_total/","selftext":"Note: This post is very long, but it also describes quite a long process and gives plenty of examples. Explaining the process of unclicking/reclicking is quite hard for me, so if anything is unclear or if you want a more detailed explanation, feel free to ask, I will gladly answer. I saw a couple of people on this subreddit asking for more detailed posts, so here you go, I hope it helps. If you are in a similar situation and you think that I could help you with clicking/reclicking you can always send me a message on reddit.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHi, I'm 20 years old, from Germany. I listened to the real talk for the past year, so I already had quite some insights to begin with and also already knew my core value: Comfort. I had some detailed talks with a good friend a few years ago about how I sometimes behaved (in school) and where that came from, which resulted in me thinking and talking a lot about my childhood. Because of that and insights from the real talk I basically already had step 2 done.  \nSome background about that: When I was still very young, I encountered a lot of things that I didn't understand. I didn't understand why I was friends with someone in kindergarten who bullied me sometimes. I didn't understand why my father would yell at me and not let me play video games even though that was what I enjoyed doing the most. The point is: I didn't understand the world around me and there was no one to explain it to me, everything just felt unfair. It didn't make sense to me that the world was so cruel, that there's wars and people hurting each other. All of that resulted in me wanting to flee from that reality, so I developed a craving for video games and fantasy books, because I was able to understand those worlds and they gave me a chance to escape my cruel reality. Another main thing about my comfort core value was procrastination: I was a master at procrastinating, and I started hating that more and more, especially in the past year, because I actually had to get things done since I finished school. Still, I procrastinated.  \nMainly because of that I already had a lot of dissonance towards my comfort core value because I kept wasting a LOT of time. One main thing that always bothered me a lot was that I used to play wow before going to bed, which almost always resulted in me going to bed far too late, not getting enough sleep, having a fucked up sleep schedule and so on. I hated it, but I still did it and I couldn't change, not permanently at least. I was sometimes able to go about my day quite structured and logically, getting a lot of things done. At the end of the day though when I was a lot less concentrated, I just fell back on procrastinating, which resulted in playing wow. And if I didn't play wow, I watched shitty youtube videos, tv series or similar stuff. So I already had my comfort core value loaded with a lot of dissonance. I hadn't been listening to real talk for a while, but on October 16th I got back into it by listening to the twitch VoD of October 9th. That one really triggered something for me and the following days I was a lot more aware about my dissonance towards comfort and I wanted it to change. I listened to a lot of real talk and also listened to the ones about clicking that were available at that time. I thought a lot about the insights and stayed up longer on Tuesday night (October 18th), listening to real talk while playing wow. Playing wow caused insane dissonance at that point and I just quit, fully focusing on the real talk. When I went to bed, I couldn't fall asleep for almost an hour. I felt as anxious as almost never before in my life, I felt a lot of fear. I think that was the point where my comfort core value basically realised that it was close to dying. What also helped a lot was understanding that I would be able to get rid of all of my bullshit with logic as my core value instead of comfort. I told myself that logic would fix all my problems and I welcomed it with open arms, I embraced it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Clicking:**  \nWhen I woke up on Wednesday I only got ~4 hours of sleep due to having an appointment at a doctor at 11am. Still, I felt a clarity I had never felt before and I was really concentrated. All of the noise and bullshit around me was gone and I realised that I must've made the click, although it was hard for me to say when exactly it happened. When I got into the car to drive to the doctor, I didn't even want to listen to music while driving (I used to always listen to music while driving). I rather wanted to just drive without music because it seemed like noise to me, disturbing the calmness that I had in my mind. I didn't feel any social anxiety anymore and also felt a lot more confident. Throughout the day and also the following day (Thursday), I felt really euphoric, literally jumping around because, well, everything just made sense. I finally managed to get rid of all of my bullshit that I was working on getting rid of for the past years.  \nI was even more amazed on Thursday evening when I streamed, because I was able to play a lot better than usually in Warcraft III, resulting in a 9:1 score. I won games against opponents that I would've usually lost against. In general I was as concentrated as never before while streaming, having an easy time to keep almost all of the things about the game in mind, while answering questions in the chat, etc. I also thought only in solutions, whereas before I used to always focus on the problems a lot. For example when I lost a unit in Warcraft III due to an unnecessary mistake, I often times thought about it for minutes, thinking about the if's, would have's and could have's and lost the game because of not focusing on what was actually going on. After the click, when something like that happened, I just looked at what was going on in the game right now and made the best out of it. I didn't keep myself busy with the past.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Unclicking:**\nThe weeks before the click I already had a lack of sleep and a messed up sleep schedule. That got even worse in the days after the click because I went to bed late. I just couldn't go to bed early and instead kept working on things that were on my list. When I then finally went to bed, I still couldn't fall asleep for a long time. Even though I was really tired, I just couldn't fall asleep. My brain was on fire and it didn't stop racing, constantly busy with rewiring all the bullshit of my past. I then couldn't get much sleep at all because I still had to wake up at a certain time because of my environment. Additionally to the lack of sleep came some dissonance that I had because of certain interactions with my environment. Example: I used to always watch a tv series with my brother while we were eating something after working out together. After the click I absolutely didn't feel like watching that tv series anymore because it was just a waste of time to me. I told him that I don't want to watch it anymore and he was like \"Oh do you really have to bring it so far?!\" and he was pretty pissed. I thought that it didn't make sense that if I had logic as my core value, that I would get into a position where he would still react like that. Afterwards I realised that I told him that in a bad way and I could've gone about that conversation in a better way in order to not make him upset. The point here is that I experienced a lot of dissonance because I felt like the way that I went about that conversation was worse than how I could've gone about it. This example might only seem like a small thing, and it is, but it resulted in quite some dissonance that I was actually able to work out after a few minutes. So the dissonance was gone, but the doubt wasn't. Those kind of situations that caused dissonance for me started to create doubt towards the legitimacy of my click. Even though I was quite sure that I really clicked, I still doubted it because of those kind of situations. The lack of sleep also brought up some doubt. \"Why would I get into a situation where I'm sleep-deprived even though I have logic as my core value? That doesn't make sense.\"\nSo the doubt started spreading more and more and I also got less and less concentrated because of the lack of sleep. Then it got even worse. Relatives from Italy visited for 1 week and they were staying at our place. I still needed to be compatible with my environment, so I basically played my role to stay compatible. That resulted in a week of a lot of bullshit. Let's just say that I was always quite a bit different with how I wanted to spend my time compared to my family/relatives (that was especially the case after the click). There were situations that caused insane dissonance for me and I didn't have the time + space to work it out. I was basically busy the whole week long, going for a lot of trips, etc. That also got me in a position where I couldn't work out, which was always very important for my concentration/sharpness.\nShort summary: The combination of lack of sleep and not working out caused me to be a lot less concentrated. Multiple dissonance-inducing situations also caused me to doubt the legitimacy of my click. All that spiraled out of control and I just felt like I lost the click overtime and I was back to my old comfort core value again, because there were too many things that didn't seem to make sense.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Reclicking:**\nAfter unclicking and my relatives leaving again, I was in a pretty bad shape. sleep-deprived +  fucked up sleep schedule, not working out, accepting that I unclicked and not having the concentration/mental capacity to think properly about it. I started watching tv series again, wasting time and just feeling bad about myself. I couldn't even work out anymore, even until now because I had an accident the day before my relatives left. I injured one of my ribs which made it impossible to work out properly. Working out was always the main thing that helped me a lot with concentration and just well-being + confidence overall. Not having it made me feel especially bad. I went into a ~2 week phase where I just felt depressed. I was okay with comfort before clicking. Before the click comfort was still acceptable, but now I had something to compare it to. The difference between my comfort-self and my logic-self was tremendous and I just wanted the logic-self back, it felt so much more fulfilling, it was just better in every single way. All that caused me to be really sad, I didn't feel like doing anything. Everything just felt meaningless with comfort as a core value. I actually got deeper and deeper into that kind of depressive state because I wanted to create as much dissonance as possible towards comfort. During the whole time of my relatives visiting and those 2 weeks where I felt bad, my main goal was reclicking. What I cared about the most during all that \"unclicked time\", was to reclick. So to a certain extent I think I kind of forced that sadness onto myself to create more dissonance because I reworked the 4 steps as much as possible, but it didn't do enough for the reclick.  \nOn Thursday (November 17th) I listened to the real talk VoD of November 7th (first 30mins), the one where Athene talks about the differences of objective, intersubjective and subjective reality. Something in that talk gave me the right trigger and I felt euphoric again, I finally reclicked. It didn't feel nearly as powerful as the initial click, but it was very relieving, I didn't have to feel bad anymore. Since then I got rid of the bad habits again that crawled back into my life after unclicking, I am getting enough sleep, fixing my sleep schedule, taking better care of eating (was pretty sloppy with that during the unclicked phase) and restructuring a lot of things. Most importantly, I am doing my best at resolving all the dissonance that I experience to make sure that I don't unclick again. Basically my main focus right now is to stay clicked.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion/Thoughts:**\nWhile being in the unclicked state, I didn't entirely fall back to my old self that I was before the click. Instead it was like a mix of logic + my old comfort. Unclicking didn't make me lose all the benefits of the click. I still had no identity-related feelings, I still thought a lot more in solutions rather than in problems, I still went about things more effectively, and so on. I'm not even sure if I even really fell back to having comfort as a core value. It felt more like my new logic core value got immensely cluttered by remnants of the past up until the point where I just couldn't see through all the clutter anymore and thus lost myself in it.  \nMetaphorically speaking I was surrounded by so much garbage that I couldn't see through it anymore. At the same time I still had some valuable things in my pockets (remnants of the click: no more identity, more solution-oriented thinking,  ...) and I still knew where I wanted to go: Get out of this maze of garbage and find my logic core value again.  \nOne of the most important things I learned through my reclicking journey is this: Do. Not. Give. Up. You can do it, you just need to find the path. If you feel bad about yourself use that as a tool if possible. In the end you need to find your own way to having logic as your core value, and that can be hard and you might feel like shit on the way, but it will all be worth it.  \nAdopting Logic as my core value was the best thing that ever happened to me.","createdAt":1479687493,"score":7,"author":"Syntoren","id":"5e13o0"},{"title":"How I weirdly clicked","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5e0evc/how_i_weirdly_clicked/","selftext":"How old are you and where are you from? From Sweden and 17 Years old.\n\nHow long did it take to make the click? About 3-4 weeks.\n\nHow long have you been depressed? 3 years.\n\nFirst day - When I felt like I'm about to click, I just decided to finish elementary school because that is logical for me because if something goes wrong at Athene's house I gotta go back and start working.\n\nSecond day - I said fuck it I'm gonna fix the basement to make a gym, I need to start working out and so I began to move all the trash in there to the trailer. That took me a while and it was a good workout too. (Reason for me making a gym is that you don't have to bicycle all the way to the gym, I feel like It's more effective to make a gym at home.)\n\nThird day - This day didn't happen so much except I had a meeting with my school and that went well, wasn't too exciting. I was just generally tired all day, didn't do so much.\n\nFourth day - I was repairing the gym walls with my dad, and then later I went up to my room and started watching Athene's stream a bit then I came up with the question, is it possible to click without feeling it in 1 second? I felt that I was about to click for 4 days, It felt like I had 1% out of 99% I was really close to clicking and when I asked Rex on discord if the click can be spread out in 4 days to click?\n\nThen he gave me these questions\n\n1. You have a strong emotional desire to understand everything logically\n2. Any action that is logical flows naturally and does not require any discipline or motivation\n3. You experience a lot of dissonance doing things that are illogical or when you have contradictory thoughts or emotions\n\nI matched with everything. \n\nThen I felt it, holy shit I've just clicked, I had 99% but that question was the tipping tower for me to reach 100%. I could feel the dopamine rush down in my body as my hands started to shake.\n\nIf I didn't trust logic this much I would have never done the things I've done for the past 4 days because of depression.\n\nAll my problems are gone.

I previously had placebo click because I didn’t approach it the right way, I thought that I can do it just with my rational part of the brain and totally ignore emotional aspect that is essential for clicking so in the end I was confronted with reality and I realized that I was lying to myself the whole time just to stay in my comfort bubble. So I started all over again.    \n \n**Step 1**: In order to develop trust in logic I was looking for a field of science that was really interesting to me and create the most positive emotions in me. I looked at all the materials that were recommended on logicwiki page [link](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Content_to_help_you_appreciate_logic) and the Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey was making me most emotional so I made routine to watch one episode each morning to start the day with some appreciation of logic and to not to start procrastinate from morning. Also every time I went outside instead to listen music as I always did I tried to listen to the surroundings and appreciate the nature and world around me. But that was not enough, I still couldn’t made logic appealing to my inner child in other words I didn’t feel so much positive emotions when thinking about logic. Then I read that some people find illustrating logic like mother, friend or god to be helpful. I tried with the god and it worked really well because in past I was religious person.    \n\n**Step 2**: to make sure that I was going to find my true core value I sat down in my room with notebook and pen, put myself in meditative state where I had clear mind and started to look for the most emotional moments in my life that I can remember and wrote it down on the paper. During this I started to feel really unpleasant because it was exposing how much harm my core value did to me. I came to conclusion that my core value was comfort that originated from validation seeking because of low self-esteem. Then I tested it to confirm that I understood everything and to confirm if it was actually the case. I had a bag of chewing gum with 20 gums in it. I had episodes of emotional eating so I was thinking: I know that I will have dissonance when I eat all of them at once and I will tell myself that this is stupid but at the same time I will feel really good on emotional level because I have comfort as a core value. I ate them all and my predictions was right so I was sure that comfort was my core value.    \n\n**Step 3:** It took couple of days of tries because my emotional intelligence was not so high therefore I was having hard times whenever I tried to talk to my inner child also he tried to protect current core value by reminding me of all my warm memories from past. I realized that my inner child was too attached to comfort. I took the notebook with my past memories from step 2 and I started to think how having comfort as a core value screw me my whole life and what was possible if I had logic as my core value in that painful moments. As I was doing it I started to fell more and more dissonance and sadness. Based on projection what comfort will do to me if I will keep it as a core value I started to imagine comfort as me who has cataract, bedsores, and anorexia from playing games and living in a comfort bubble all life. My inner child was holding my comfort hand and I imagined logic as god that was standing next to them and was reaching to my inner child with his helping hand. In that moment I was really at the emotional core, I felt so much dissonance and was so grossed out by my comfort that I let go of my comfort hand and stand in the middle of logic and comfort. I was scared and didn’t know if I want to adopt logic but after a second I jumped and hug logic with all my strength. My heart started beating like hammer, I had huge chill running through my body and the endorphin rush hit my head. At first I was truly happy but at the same time I was scared to lose it so I immediately started to do logical things. My head was flooded with questions so I was reading lots of logic wiki and listening to podcasts that I missed.    \n\nRight now I logically rewiring my brain and sometimes dissonance occur but I try to find logical answers to the questions that pop up in my head. The most fear I had after click is that I’m going to lose it when I wake up next day but I still have logic as a core value so I’m really happy about it. To all people that want to click I strongly advise you to make sure that you do the 4 steps on emotional level, it’s not too difficult to click but I think it’s impossible to click without going emotionally about it.\nAlso don’t make my mistake and don’t overthink it. Most of the time it’s just your inner child that don’t want to click and you not realizing that.

Normal was 2 to even 4 pm. I pushed it to 10-11 am. At some point started working out. I tried to find my core value with no definite answers, though I think I primed myself to be more in the touch with my emotional part during this phase. I picked up the tip to visualize. I sat down, closed my eyes, focused on the present and asked myself 'what drives me in this moment?'. I saw a somewhat younger version of myself (maybe 16, I'm 22 now) who concentrated on my mind palace which was a symbol for my intellectual and personal growth. I went to it and asked it, 'why not take this instead?' I showed it a visual representation of logic. A yellow/ golden ball of floating 'interfaces/ screens' maybe an equation floating around in and out of it sometimes. I told it that intellectual growth would be part of it anyway and actually give a boost to it. It accepted it. Visually it took it in its hands and concentrated on it. I knew something was not right, the yellow globe had a red portion like an error message. Something was keeping me from accepting this value. I told this 16 year old me 'hold on to it, I go and check it out.' It was a really natural process. I was somewhat guiding what happened but it more or less played out in my mind on its own. I found a child version of me at a place of no significance I dreamed of the night before. In hindsight I think it is kind of symbolic how I went into a more deeper, maybe more subconscious part than before. My inner child had a teddy bear or something similar in its arms. I tried to take it away from it but it only grasped tighter on it. I produced the logic ball and wanted to convince it that it was better than the teddy. It wanted to trick me. Visually it embraced the teddy so tight that it molded with it so I would never have the option to replace the teddy or else harming my inner child. I saw through the deception and laughed. It was just hiding the teddy behind its back. I asked it 'why don't you wan't to make the click?'. It answered 'because I'm special!'. This made sense since when everybody makes the click I would be the one who could not do it and therefore be special. I realized this was something deep in my personality structure or whatever you want to call it. I remembered a concept that I realized some time ago and that I appreciated a lot. That what I experience as the 'I' or my body in relation to 'the external' is just a framework that my brain build, since it is useful to think this way to maximize reproductive fitness. But the physical matter doesn't care where my body ends and air or whatever starts. 'See?', I told my inner child, 'The whole concept of our being as something discriminable from the rest of matter makes no sense, so trying to be special does surly not make sense at all.' The next moment I got really excited and told it: 'And that is something you yourself already appreciated!'. Then I had a really strong emotional experience 'happy excitement' I would say. My heart pounded crazy strong. I was shaking and breathing really deep and fast. I had a vibrational like sensation in waves across the right of my head. Visually there were streams of a glowing fluid squirting from the place my inner child that sat in a meditating position to this right brain part. This was especially meaningful to me since I have had a bad salvia trip where I believed that I somehow fucked this part of my brain. And at this click moment it felt like it was part of me again and healed. I got up and felt very clear. Still I was very doubtful if it was legit. I asked myself 'was this really it?' I got on the discord and described my thoughts at this moment in the chat. A clicker asked if I wanted to talk. I realized that I was excited about what to say to him and since I wrongly thought there are no senseless emotions after the click (step 3), I put it in a negative light. I saw it as social anxiety and thought It must be proof that I pseudo clicked. I committed to the pseudo click story line and I think I unclicked in this moment ca. 3-4min after the click. Had I just asked myself 'why do I feel this way?' I would have known the logical reason quick and it would have been gone. The way I see it there are still 'old' activity patterns that are likely to take place in the brain or some part of the brain (due to its structure -&gt; 'old pathways'). Effectively I actually felt this pattern spatially in front of me and somewhat to the left, by the heart. And in hindsight it would have been very easy to resist it, understand it logically and make it go but I kind of 'went' into it. \n\nFollowing the path:\nI told myself that I just need to keep trying, that I haven't found my true core value and have to go deeper. But I also kept asking myself if I clicked and unclicked and or that I just need to do step 4. I did more logical stuff throughout my days. When engaging in meaningless games/ series/ YT vids, I quickly felt some kind of 'uneasy impatience'. I discovered that when I kept watching longer than a critical point (between 3-6 min), I would numb to it. I guess that happens when old pathways/ habits take over more and influence affective states and overall 'mindset' whatever that is. I realized that doing stupid stuff would stimulate me only very primitively and it was a senseless thing to do, since it brought me away from clicking. \nOne experience where I realized I changed into something better was when my mum came over. Normally this would have upset me a lot since it is hard to deal with her. She needed help installing a printer driver on her laptop. She has no intuition dealing with computer interfaces and its very cumbersome to explain her even something like navigating to her download folder. As I watched her I could truly see her as a person of her own with her own reality, a concept I often visited rationally. But at this moment I was very calm, which would not have been the case weeks earlier. I emotionally saw her as kind of a lost child and actually had something like paradoxical father feelings for her. Which I guess is not that uncommon for people with ill or otherwise debilitated parents but never was remotely the case for me (I did feel sorry for her before but this was something entirely different). Acting on this mindset, I showed her how to change her desktop background. Since I saw that she always googled 'sky' and looks at images before turning of her laptop, I changed it to a picture of a sky. I think this was the first in a long time when somebody did actually something nice for her. So it was a touching moment for both of us I guess. \n\nThe reclick:\nOne week ago when meditating on trying to click, I felt disturbed by some sounds my neighbors made. In this moment I realized that this was a somewhat good mechanism when trying to grow intellectually since it drives you to make your environment minimally disturbing. In the past I would be very restless when I was in the same room with a running TV/ radio. I would have the acute feeling that my focus was diverted. I realized that this was something that was part of the outdated neural patterns. I told myself that emotionally reacting to disturbances is actually not helping when trying to focus on anything. I said to myself that this would not be a problem if logic was my core value. At that moment I experienced something very similar to the initial click though weaker. Now I think that my core value was logic since the first click and that at the second click I took away a large chunk of the patterns that I succumbed to. This really helped me to keep the momentum rolling. I was still very skeptical whether I actually clicked now or not but every time I thought about it, I came to the conclusion that thinking about it too much is a waste of time and I'd rather just do logical stuff. \n\nThe changes:\nI pushed my sleep cycle farther forward. I actually get up at 8 am now and it feels right. I see the world from a different perspective now. I had dreads for 5.5 years and kind of wanted to test myself whether my identity is still there. I predicted that I would get dissonance when cutting them, it was not so initially. It was just something I did like anything else. In the night I woke up and felt crazy dissonance. I guess sleeping potentially brings a lot activity to old pathways but thats no problem. I just sat up and thought about it logically. My old pathways cried in pain over having lost a big part of their identity but there is nothing to be afraid of. The dissonance instantly got rekt be a warm glowing ball in its ccore. Its like having this religious mechanism where nothing can harm you since logic takes care of you. \nHumans do random shit that is not helping with achieving our potential. And its actually very simple to see through the bullshit that people reinforce themselves constantly. I think that this (Neodarwinian) meme will will make the world a much better place. So not spreading it would be unmoral even. Also I realized that a lot of things could be worse right now. I could be the only person on the planet with this insight, fortunately this is not so. Or a hundred different ways in which the world could be more fucked than its current state. I am very lucky to even be in this state where I have the capacity to think about this stuff. I see the world now as this large equation and I'm the only variable, so making the most impact is not even in discussion but just a fact that defines my being. One thing that gave me dissonance was that since I was so unsure whether I clicked, I thought couldn't spread it truly. Now I realized that my story can potentially give insight on how re-clicking can happen which makes it even more important to share it and start spreading this, so I made this post.

He mentioned he spent time talking about the Theory of Everything, quantum mechanics, and multiworlds possibilty. I used this to overcome a dramatic change in my life that left me feeling sad and without identity. Starting off in the world on my own at 18 and my family being torn apart. So I used my understanding and reasoning as a tool and had a dark view of possibilities that made me believe nothing mattered and I could do whatever I wanted with confidence. I ended up developing a core value in comfort with this success with rationalization as a tool (not logic). This made it hard for me to click at first but I could see that I was missing and not feeling complete. When I identified this key moment it was easier to let go of that identity and all that was left was my faith in logic. Now I have the best understanding of my purpose I see and have better connections with my wife and my child. My wife and child are happier and we are creating better experiences and working together.

After a while I started writing down my life in detail, all the moments that were important: \n\nThe first moment was when I was 12 and my best friend at time decided to spend a lot of time in a new group that I didn’t really fit in. Before I would always be in the middle of any group, always watching out for my friend so he wouldn’t get left behind, but at that moment I felt left behind and rationalized that I had to be the problem. My first reaction was to fit in with that group, but it didn’t work out for long. After that I took distance from that group, found a new best friend and we ended up isolating more from the rest. I build up an identity of being better than others to cope with the underlying feeling of low self-esteem that was caused by my friend “leaving me behind”. \nMy emotional objective became to gain value in the eyes of others, but also for my own skeptic eyes. I became a banker and got a degree in economics, that wasn’t cutting it, I had a paradigm shift to instead of money and status (“Up in the air” helped a lot in that) have growing as a person and helping humanity move forward as my excuse to gain value. Eventually I came over to work together with Athene and that helped to strengthen that core. \n\nI wrote all these things and more down and really thought about it; I understood rationally what my emotional motivations were but that was not enough. The next day Tim clicked a guy from Sweden that came over recently but it didn’t look like he was going to stay. The previous days he looked very insecure and his whole body language was screaming dissonance. After he clicked his whole body language changed and he became very calm. His potential went up and it was causing me a lot of dissonance because it was conflicting with my core value of gaining value. \n\nI went in my room under my covers again that evening and started to emotionally reinforce the dissonance I was feeling. I went through my notes from the previous day and emotionally connected how I felt then to increase the feeling of anger in the beginning, which turned into sadness.  When I felt really sad I imagined how logic could have helped me in all these situations that made me feel sad and after that I imagined how logic reaches out a helping hand to help me stand up again. I felt a feeling of excitement in my stomach and chest, but I was afraid of losing it, so I watched the last episode of Cosmos (2014). At the end of the episode I was left in tears of joy, inspired by and in awe of the world we live in and I stood up from my bed and went downstairs to write down my experience in detail until 7am. \n\nLooking back, I would say my core value was comfort that was caused by low self-esteem that was caused by the feeling of being worth less than others. I used fitting in, validation from others, money, status and logic as tools to fulfill that core. Gaining value was how I emotionally framed it and the feeling of gratefulness and emotionally connecting that logic would help me the most made me go through this paradigm shift.\n","createdAt":1479214476,"score":15,"author":"P4ndem1c","id":"5d2cad"},{"title":"Having trouble appreciating logic in its core","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5d34rc/having_trouble_appreciating_logic_in_its_core/","selftext":"Hi,\n\nI watched most of the documentaries and videos on the logic wiki.

However, I just dont care, or atleast not enough. I cant really grasp my head around it. All I can think of when I see how everything is based on logic is something along the lines of \"cool.\", but nothing more. \n\nI guess it comes down to me not really comprehenting  on an emotional level why I should structure my life logically. Athene explained that we are like a cell of a bigger organism, and just do what we have to do which is the most logical thing. \n\nRight now I'm studying to become a teacher and one of the motivations for me taking that path was to try to have a positive influence on the youth and thus having a positive impact on the world.

Athene even said our brain in like many different circuits and different thought process going on simultaneously on and off. Just because we tell ourself \"logic will bring us safety\" doesn't really mean anything to me because your \"logic\" can conflict with other \"logic\" or thought processes and you will create dissonance and anxiety about the possibility of choices and making the wrong choice. Logic can bring us safety and comfort when things make sense then in that moment you feel like you've done something right. But how do we live without comfort or social acceptance we need social rectification. Why should we run away from the fact that we want to be comfortable and why in the world would do we want to be in a constant state of cognitive dissonance?

That we can do anything and be anyone and should not be comfortable but we need to balance comfort and logical incontentness (action??).\n\nHappiness is instantaneous and is something you feel in the moment.

I do not understand why we get comfort or happiness when we understand and use logic to create connections besides the idea that this reward for knowledge and creating connections in the brain is what propels us evolutionarily to do it again and make more \"connections\" which creates more possibilities which could of lead to the entire topological evolution of the brain as we know it.\n\nJust something to think about, but what do I know anyway?\n\n~EnigmaticDragon","createdAt":1479254834,"score":1,"author":"EnigmaticDragon","id":"5d62dg"},{"title":"The biggest issue with click (IMO)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5d5rv8/the_biggest_issue_with_click_imo/","selftext":"I think this is not going to change the world and that is because there are bilions of people which are religious and their core value is religion.

This was quite powerful for me as I used to be religious and a lot of what they were saying I've heard so many times during religious conventions and meetings, but instead of God they were talking about Logic and it just made so much sense to me. I had a lot of issues with religion and the concept of God so I never really accepted those statements (God loves you no matter what. He is your best friend. You can always rely on him. He will never abandon you etc.) but with logic it worked so well for me. This is where I though I had clicked, I felt a sense of relief and great clarity, I started thinking about how I can really trust logic and how it is something that I can always rely on no matter what, and I started thinking how beautiful that was, I felt really happy and couldn't stop smiling, that day I fell asleep with a massive smile on my face as I couldn't stop thinking how awesome logic is. Next I wanted to find out if I really did click.  \n\n\n\nThe next day I started feeling ill because of couple of sleepless nights due to stress caused by some interviews I had. For the next 3-4 days I felt really tired with a constant headache, but even with that happening my actions where a lot more logical then usual. However, I have been hating on \"comfort\" for about 3 years at this point and yet I would still play video games as I seem to have developed a way of turning off my rational thinking as soon as I start playing games, so no matter how logical I was once I \"get in the zone\" of escapism I don't break out of it easily. Only when I stopped playing would I feel any dissonance. During those days I only \"wasted time\" for about 3-4 hours, but that was already a big red flag. You might say that I obviously haven't clicked if I played any video games at all but I don't think that is necessarily true, whenever I'm faced with \"not knowing what to do\" instead of exploring my options I tend to do nothing and distracting myself as it's easier then feeling the dissonance of not knowing what to do (essentially \"comfort\" takes over). After I got better I was afraid I was slipping back to my old ways and tried following the 4 steps, with no results. This was followed by a panic attack (this is not something frequent, this was my 4th one ever) but I manged it better than ever the following day I was feeling another panic attack coming and instead of giving into it I started analysing, best I could, what was happening and managed to stop it before it got bad. I think this strong emotional event has put me further back towards \"comfort\" and away from Logic. This again has put me at ease with doing illogical things, not completely but still.  \n\n\n\nSo I have either pseudo clicked and the effects have now partially worn off , or I have clicked and now I have \"unclicked\" because of my insufficient trust in logic. Either way, I'm back to square one. Trying to click again.   \n\n\nOne thing that I find difficult is attaching a negative emotion to \"comfort\". I've been hating my bullshit \"comfort\" core value for about 3 years, but never knew what to do about it and at this point I think I've become comfortable with being uncomfortable about \"comfort\"... This got me thinking. If it's not possible for me to create an emotional response towards comfort any longer. Might it be possible to swap the core value to Logic by simply doing as much logical things as possible and expanding my awareness and with time the core value will replace itself?

The comfort might be perceived as feeling good about what they are doing. But it goes pretty far, even if they realize how fucked up and damaging their belief system is and that they don't care about anything besides feeling good about themselves, they will just leave one comfort-bubble and switch to another one. \n\nOf course safety is something everyone craves for and in our actions we always seek ways to feel good about what we are doing, but those with comfort as core value can have it a bit more extreme. Many people would experience dissonance once they figure out that they were lying to themselves to feel good. But if you are one of those that don't even see why it is wrong to lie to yourself, because you can come up with explanations like “I can still feel good so I don't have to change anything” or “I would prefer to not think about these things and I wouldn't even mind doing so”, you got probably very good at betraying yourself and with your core value comfort, you learned to find a new physical or mental environment that will give you the safety you desire. \n\nThis would not work for most other core values, as going back to for example validation seeking feels just awful every time you do it. It is way harder to rationalize why seeking validation is still the best motivation to have, basically the safety it grants can not be used as an argument anymore. Comfort on the other hand allows you to be way more exotic with finding excuses as you immediately experience the safety that comes with your new lie. \n\nIs there hope for those advanced deniers? Would be great to hear comments of people that managed to overcome it. We know that some people with comfort were able to change their core value just by realizing how much it helps others. \n\nI would think increasing your awareness, so you are fully conscious of the consequences of your actions or more precisely your non-actions should help you to create dissonance. Btw it is a very common bias that doing nothing is less bad, than taking action, even if the action could prevent more harm. (see [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) &amp; [omission bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omission_bias)) \n\nYou need to realize that your omission (staying in comfort) is doing more harm, and if you don't care about others, realize that it does more harm to yourself as well. Facing this will create a lot of dissonance but you need to love this dissonance because it will help you to move on. Keep hammering on the implications your comfort has. You might find yourself feeling comfortable on the next day, then you need to bring it up again, over and over, you can not accept the denial anymore. If you managed to get a good understanding of how damaging your comfort to you and others is, write down those insights to remind you in moments were you feel good about yourself again. You will learn to spot the lies that your comfort is creating and you will stop believing them. \n\nThis approach will obviously create a lot of dissonance, which is a good thing cause it means you are challenging your comfort, just make sure you already appreciation logic and you understand that it can provide safety for you ([step 1](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Main_Page#Step_1:_Develop_an_unconditional_trust_in_logic)).\n\nRemember that your mind is telling you stories to stay in your comfort bubble and it is up to you if you believe them or not. If you would be in a life threatening situation you would immediately make the best decisions to survive. You might feel too comfortable right now to realize it but you are still making decisions all the time that have a huge impact.","createdAt":1479152126,"score":12,"author":"rafael136","id":"5cxvd6"},{"title":"Thank you Athene","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5cyiei/thank_you_athene/","selftext":"I'm not very fluent with English so I'm not gonna write a poem, I came here just to chip in my 2 cents and say that it's no bullshit and how easy it is, when you click you'll understand why it's called \"click\" because it's a rapid shift, one moment it's you and then - it's you after you click.

Most things I would tackle with a huge amount of distrust because it had to fit my high expectations. What took a while for me to realize was that it wasn't my values that were setting those high goals. It will all make sense in a bit. \n\n\nSo I had those high expectations, about a girlfriend, about my job, about what I should do with my life, but also about ideas and beliefs other people would have. I would try to find flaws and problems everywhere and distrust was so present, that at some point I thought it must be my core value. But it was only part of the story. There was another component and that wouldn't want to fit into the “high expectations” approach. It was comfort. I would refrain from many pleasures just so I wouldn't have to work for it. Not because I was so modest or not greedy, but I would rather live with less than having to put extra work. In my past I tried to appreciate the simple lifestyle so I could stay in my comfort-bubble. \n\n\nBut how can this behavior fit into an overall very skeptical mindset with high expectations? How could one with the highest expectations stay in his comfort bubble and not work hard for his dreams. There was an important link missing. The reason why I would strive for those ambitious goals was simply because I was craving for appreciation. Nothing was good enough to get the appreciation of others, I had to outshine the rest to make sure I would get acknowledged. I wouldn't blatantly show off, but very subtle steer the attention for example in a conversation on my insights, endeavors or adventures plans. Of course this was happening on a subconscious level and I wasn't aware of it until recently. If I wouldn't be able to find a work or undertaking that could grant me appreciation from others as a reward, I wouldn't go for it, hence I would fall back on my comfort from time to time, when I figured out that the current approach wasn't working. And I tried many things and many times I had to realize it was not working. \n\n\nYou might know this feeling of not being able to fully commit to something. When you feel like you should just go ham and work with all your conviction on something you believe in, but it just feels half-assed all the time. That was what I experienced. And I couldn't understand why. I was picking the most honorable undertakings I could think of but I would still feel inhibited to fully commit. Why? Well, I never really wanted it or thought it was important, instead I was doing it because I was trying to get something out of it, to get peoples appreciation so I could feel better about myself. With this attitude you are not able to achieve great things. I was doing it so it was just enough. After a while I would just give up again, because I wouldn't have the endurance to push through rough times, so I would fall back on comfort. \n\n\nBut how could I possibly find something I would truly care for? I had to admit to myself that I didn't even know what I truly cared for. It felt like I didn't really care for anything or anyone and that was actually not too far from reality. I was mainly trying to feel good about myself and as long as that was unsatisfied, I felt unable to go further and care for anyone else. \n\n\nBut the approach was flawed. I had to realize that I would never feel good about myself, when making myself and my emotional integrity dependent on others and their opinion, validation, attention, approval and love. I was an addict, a social appreciation junky, everything I did came from that craving. I was trapped and even making Logic my new core value felt impossible, as I would only do it to for the same reasons. \n\n\nThe more I was working on understanding my life and the decisions I made, the more I could see the patterns, the dishonesty to myself, I was living an empty life in fear. If you feel like you have to proof yourself all the time to be acknowledged, you are living a life in fear of failing, being not good enough and fucking up. Doubts and distrust are strong companions. It was a hard process but once I had the full picture, I was determined to change. I was telling myself over and over again, I don't want to lie to myself anymore. I knew I could unlock so much potential and all the noise and distraction I experienced was part of my core value, thoughts how I would come across and trying to be liked by others drained so much energy and decreased overall sharpness constantly (see [spotlight effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_effect)). \n\n\nThe next stepping stone was learning to trust. It felt hard to fully trust something as if I was my whole life avoiding to trust or have strong beliefs. Maybe because I was scared to fully commit. What if I would figure out it was not good enough, then I would be not good enough. \n\n\nBut now I understood that I had to learn to trust, else I would always stay a validation addict in fear of being unworthy. I was making myself an emotional slave. I understood the need of a solid foundation of my belief system, so I wouldn't depend on others anymore. \n\n\nAt that point I developed already an understanding of how reality is structured in mathematical patterns or better, the structure of reality is governed by logical regularities. Humans create a concept of logic, but we can also discover in nature relations that follow those principles, precisely and consistently. We might not always understand them yet, but everything follows those cause-effect relationships. \n\n\nSo rationally I got that part, but how could I emotionally attach to the idea, that everything is Logic and therefor I could fully trust it and gain confidence out of it. As I said, I still had to learn to trust. I was looking into religion. I was wondering how Christians would be able to trust in something so abstract and for me surreal like God. I found [this text](https://www.joycemeyer.org/articles/ea.aspx?article=how_trusting_god_can_transform_your_life) of a guy explaining how trusting god changed his life. I learned Christians just tell themselves, “God will always love you, God is good, God has the power to help you, God wants to help you and God will help you”. Isn't that fascinating? They found a way to fix the problem I also experienced, the need to feel appreciated, loved and taken care of. So if I could learn to trust in a similar way Logic, which is from my understanding in a sense my creator because it is the reason and purpose for everything there is, I would be able to get this love and appreciation from Logic instead of being dependent on the appreciation of others. So I [translated the text](http://pastebin.com/N4eAWh7c) to see if it would work for me. I replaced every “God”, “Lord” and even “bible” with Logic. The sentence would now say: “Logic loves you, Logic is good, Logic has the power to help you and Logic will help you”. That kinda worked. I had to explain myself more in depth why this was safe to believe (this might help: https://logicnation.org/wiki/Content_to_help_you_appreciate_logic). It sounded illogical that Logic would love me at first, but I just went with it because it seemed to work on an emotional level. Again I was really desperate to understand how I could trust anything so I had no problem with going a bit far here and when I noticed it worked, that I would feel emotionally safe with the idea Logic could provide all these things for me, I went as far as saying I want to devote myself to serve Logic. It suddenly made perfectly sense to devote myself to something that I could fully trust, because it is the essence of what is, especially when realizing that I was devoting my life to be liked and appreciated by others in the past so I could feel better about myself, this now was actually something I felt comfortable doing with full commitment, because I know Logic will always appreciate me as much as I appreciate Logic. In return I will seek to understand Logic and do all that Logic demands and when I did that, I will trust in Logic, that it will take care for the rest.\n\n\n\nTLDR: \n\nI had to realize my core value and how it effected my life on a fundamental level. It was something like validation or appreciation seeking.\n\nI had to realize the **need** to fully commit to something I could fully trust, which turned out to be Logic.\n\nI had to learn how to trust, which I did by unconditional love by and for Logic.","createdAt":1479063200,"score":25,"author":"rafael136","id":"5crdkt"},{"title":"What exactly do you people mean by 'logic'?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5ctail/what_exactly_do_you_people_mean_by_logic/","selftext":"I stumbled onto the youtube video and am admittedly just driving by but I don't see anywhere that anyone attempts to define what they mean by logic.

I could see a pattern in some of them. They often implied an assumption that an absolute truth exists and if I would not be able to reach this certain point, I would fail. As an example the doubt: \n\n\n&gt; How can I ever trust in logic? It seems so hard to get there and if I manage to get there could I ever be certain about it? \n\n\nHere I assume that trusting in logic is something very specific that is hard to spot and I might confuse it with something else. In moments where we assume that things are in a specific way and that this “hidden” truth is discouraging or making it harder for us to reach our goals, we have to realize that it is the perceived reality that is ruling the world, not some hidden truth. When we deem ideas as absolute truths it becomes harder for us to achieve things we consider worthwhile, especially if we already have a certain level of insecurity. We create doubts about idealistic concepts like “What if I am not like this?” or “What if I wont be able to reach this?”. It is important to realize that these ideas are not real, conceptual ideas are made by the human brain and striving for them can help us achieve great things, but if you are insecure you don't want to reach for something so far and vague. You need something tangible, something real you can trust in. \n\n\nReality has nothing to do with those conceptual ideas. It is a place where people believe and act upon ideas, but if they actually match those ideas perfectly doesn't matter. No one can even measure that. And nobody cares about it either. It has no value to question whether you managed to become this idea, which is defined by the inter-subjective reality, or not. The only thing that matters is if you are able to trust it. No matter if it is the idea of success, beauty, or having logic as a core value. The only thing that matters is the perceived reality. If people perceive someone as successful, that person is successful, if people perceive someone as beautiful, the person is beautiful and if people perceive a trust in logic, they are trusting logic. \n\n\nSo my approach changed from trying to find this hidden truth of logic and trying to become exactly like  that (which felt impossible because this concept doesn't even exist nor does anyone fit this idea) to an approach where I would find a way to experience trust in logic, that was all. It really made things easier. I could just focus on how to trust something and if I could make it work with logic, I would have something real, not an idea, that would give me safety. And of course from their I could explore more about logic and all the implications trusting logic has, but first I needed to get to this level of trust and having an abstract idea made it way to hard to comprehend, achieve and trust that I achieved it.\n","createdAt":1479072209,"score":9,"author":"rafael136","id":"5cs5vj"},{"title":"I lost the click 2 weeks ago and I've clicked again.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5cktvh/i_lost_the_click_2_weeks_ago_and_ive_clicked_again/","selftext":"Hi, I'm 26 years old and I am from Spain. About 1 month ago I started to watch Athene's real talk by chance. I wanted to give my twitch prime subscription to someone that would make good use of the money so my idea was to enter the stream, subscribe and leave. I never saw the real talk, and I remember that when I joined the streaming Athene was talking about how death sentence was not good or bad, it depended on the country, the society, the situation... I wanted to hear his whole opinion so I stayed. Then he started solving all question that chat threw at him talking about logic. I remembered his video of “ This is the most important video I've ever made ”. I saw that video and really liked his ideas, but didn't fully understand his core value. Now he had my attention so I watched the next streamings.\n\nSo at this point that clicking thing didn't start yet until some days later Katarina clicked. So there was no 4 steps method or whatever, we only had Athene's insights and some guidelines to do it. \n\nSo I went for it and the first thing I did was analyze my life and what guided me on the past. At the beginning I could not specify what was my core value since as much as I thought the result was always the same, a little of each. So finally I understood that everyone have desires and seek the same things most of the time, but only one of these things are what guide and reward them. So I reduced it to two options: Comfort and self validation. \n\n\n\nComfort: The most logical idea for me was to think that my core value was comfort since I felt rewarded for not doing anything too important and just relaxing, playing videogames, watching a movie or whatever. But when I started going deeper I found problems. For example, this summer I got a temporal job which made me work 12 hours every day during almost two months, and it was a pretty physically exhausting job. I had no real problems doing it, so I was confused at first. I didn't have a real need to do this job since I had some money already and I live with my parents, but I did it anyway, so I thought maybe comfort was not my real core value.\n\nSelf validation: I never needed validation from people generally. Even I've never been shy or depressive, going through my past I realised that I had less self esteem than I thought. So some of the things that I did on my life was to prove me that I could do them, or that I had value. At first I thought that maybe it was just validation from people and I didn't want to admit it, but I've put myself in dangerous situations sometimes to help people, like in fights or arguments, and there was nobody to see me and I didn't even talked about it so much after these things happened so people would validate me. So for me it didn't translate to seeking validation from people, but from myself. I did these things for good reasons, but aswell to get validation from me. So I started thinking, maybe what I did for comfort it was actually to feed my own validation. So for example videogames. I always liked hard and competitive games, and I've been good at them, so maybe it was not comfort, it was self validation seeking from doing something that I'm good at.  That would be a good reason, for example, to play videogames and not basketball. I like both, but I'm good at videogames. So translating it to this last job I wrote about, maybe I just wanted to see if I was able to do it.\n\n\n\nI was stuck on these ideas for a couple of days. I finally came to the conclusion that I was overthinking it too much, and it was just comfort. I did the job because it would provide me 4 or 5 times the money that I would win in a month doing a computer technician job, so I could be in my comfort position again. Self validation was there aswell but what really rewarded me emotionally was comfort. So if you guys have doubts between some core values try to find what did really make you feel good. A good trick aswell is to think where did you have more duality, what made you feel more dissonance. For example, for me confort made me feel rewarded, but after playing videogames all day or hanging out with my friends, when I went to sleep I used to think “another wasted day”. My rational part was not in line with my emotional part.\n\n\n\nSo after realising my core value was flawed change just came naturally. The night I clicked I felt overwhelmed. I could not even sleep thinking about my life and rediscovering every choice I made.  I was afraid to lose this mind state but next morning I still had it. So as I said, four steps didn't exist yet, but the natural next thing to do was to start being productive. I started studying on my own about neuroscience, improving my english, working out... \n\nTwo days later I had a cold. I had fever and thinking clearly was harder for me. So the next day I thought that maybe it was logic to just relax and do mindless shit for some hours since I could not be productive even if I wanted. So I just went with my friends again and played some games. When I was healthy again after some days I already had lost the click. I kept doing logical things, but I didn't feel rewarded, I just wanted to go back to my comfort bubble. \n\n\nNext two weeks, even I was playing videogames and doing mindless shit I kept studying from time to time with the hope of getting back my click. I could not do it, I didn't feel so much dissonance as before and it was being really hard. So I started thinking again that maybe I was confused about my core value. I felt like I did not accomplish anything at all. I struggled for days and I could not manage to find where was the problem.\n\nSo two days ago I was talking with a friend about logic. He, as most people do, just went full defensive mode as soon as I started questioning most people core values and pinpointing the flaws and started claiming that I was being brainwashed or something, but like all people, with no arguments, just because what I was talking about sounded too strange. Also he is the kind of person that justifies things with “it doesn't matter, when we die anything will matter anyway”... So I remembered something I read, the quantum inmortality. As he doesn't know anything about quantum mechanics I started explaining him how particles are not governed by the same rules as macro objects, how they don't respect time for example. Then I talked with him a little bit about Schrodinger cat and, after some explanations and giving him some insights, I could show him this quantum inmortality theory. \n\nWhen I finished my explanation, unconsciously, I realised how cool was all that shit. I felt the role that logic was following on these explanations. I saw for the first time logic different, more beautiful. Then I realised  I clicked, and this was a real one. My problem was not about my core value, or how to replace it. I was overthinking it too much and not focusing on the true issue that was not trusting logic. \n\nI understood what happened the first time I clicked. I realised how shitty was my core value, this was easy. The problem was that I replaced it with logic just because Athene told us, not because I understood logic. That's why I lost it so easily, I could not see logic as something good.\n\nSo my advice for people is this. Forget about Athene. Don't click because he said it. You will realise that your core value sucks, that's easy. But if you replace it with logic before doing step one you are fucked, for real. It will be so much harder because you will lose it and getting it back is a pain in the ass.\n\n\nSo now I can think so much clearly, it is incredible what click made me not only in a emotional level, but intellectually aswell. Is like I don't have to filter my ideas through ego, or thinking that something that I will say can damage my image or things like that. There is no more noise. If you think that this is brainwashing... oh man, I'm sorry for you, and I mean it. You will miss this state of mind only for your ego, because if the click is real you'll have to admit that you have been wrong all your life. It is easier to think that people is being brainwashed. \n\nSo my next step will be to restructure my mind, apply to join Athene's crew and work hard. There is no choice! And this might sound weird, but having no choice is a good thing in this case :)\n\nGood luck guys!

Obviously its meant to read \"Clicked, unclicked, can't..\"*\n\nSo I've been lurking for some time and finally decided to make a post myself. I never asked for help because I never thought I needed it, as someone who has been into spirituality and self-development for some time already (although I have only recently realized that all this was a facade to win confidence and social validation) I am pretty experienced with inner work and self-observation. But I felt like putting my experience into words anyway, maybe someone is going through a similar experience and resonates with this.\n\nSo I clicked last week a few days after the Logic Nation video, I had dabbled with the \"Making Sense\" concept back in the day but never really got into it, instead focusing on spirituality (meditation - inquiry). However, I clicked. Atleast, I think I did. I felt an extreme surge of euphoria with a racing heartbeat unlike anything else, but apart from extreme happiness and wanting to help and do logical things afterwards, I didn't feel my awareness any more non-dual than before nor was I more present. I put this off to having meditated for a year thus already being quite present and aware.\nAnyway, the next day was great, the day after not so much. I went out drinking to meet new people (I'm new in uni and lacking friends) and put this new me to the test, was met with a generally bad experience, felt out of place, uncomfortable, anxious, all in all completely regretted going out instead of staying at home learning or inquiring. I now see that clicking is not a magic pill to endless confidence and picking up chicks, that line of thought is still being triggered by the desire for confidence and social validation. I then seemed to fall back into old behaviour patterns and lost that effortless flow of logic. \n\nFast forward a week or two. I'm doing a lot of great things, healthy, spending time on my body, spending time learning, inquiring, seems pretty good. And yet, cravings are there. I was in a positive feedback loop from the good actions I was doing, but still being tempted by videogames, snacks, the like. In other words I was disciplined, \"patched up\". I played videogames for a bit, and did not feel dissonance. Felt great actually. Doing logical things was also making me feel good, but a kind of \"normal\" good, nothing special.\n\nI do some inner work and see \"shit.. I've got this healthy daily routine with good diet, plenty of sport, meditation..and..it's COMFORTABLE\". I feel comfortable doing these things. A kind of \"higher level\" comfort than the old hedonistic pleasures, but still comfort. Last night I even stayed up till 4am reading manga, so that was the last straw. The value of comfort is still here.\n\nStill, so is logic. I was at class last week, felt the old fear and racing heart when having to talk infront of class, but I didnt really care. I could see it wasn't important, not nearly as important as learning and discovering the world, learning about my reality.\n\nSo long story short both values are there - comfort (comofrt and social validation are the two negative values, social validation is there to ensure comfort in social settings and exclude the possibilites of exclusion, rejection and humiliation, which are uncomfortable experiences, but \"comfort\" is basically the deeper one I think) and logic. Both seem to be in a constant conflict, in a head to head race. Sometimes I'm in comfort mode, craving distractions and snacks and really need to discipline myself to stay on track, usually in the mornings, othertimes I'm really conscious and in logic mode, not interested in snacks and distraction, instead pursuing knowledge etc. But I havn't been able to truely replace comfort with logic. Now its comfort patched up with logic, which seems to be making it much harder to actually reclick. Damn. I've even considered going full on comfort for like a week and then starting from scratch, instead continuing this constant two-way conflict of patched up comfort, which is so deceptive, but maybe that's just the desire for comfort talking.\n\nI tried replicating my first time clicking. But it's not working, repeating what I've said, visualizing a conversation with my inner child, going through my past again, it's all like \"been there done that\" and it's not working a second time.\n\nSo yeah, long post but wanted to share. I read another post from a reclicker who also said reclicking is a lot harder. It seems the line between comfort and logic has become thinner and harder to see, both have kind of merged into this flawed thing, I don't know. It's hard to explain.\n\n\n","createdAt":1478960078,"score":3,"author":"jabulaniman","id":"5ckjvh"},{"title":"Need feedback in me trying to make the click","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5cjum9/need_feedback_in_me_trying_to_make_the_click/","selftext":"I think that I have been really close to making the click.

I spent most of my life and free time to play WoW since it came out. I always was very driven by it and was extremely lazy with my lifestyle overall. \n\nI first heard about the click shortly after it became a thing at maybe the 15th of October. I was following Athene from the very beginning, and stayed hooked because of his scientific content and views on life. I was already interested in his “Real Talks” etc., so I already had a big awareness of my flawed lifestyle. I was very sceptical about the click for the first few days of watching the stream, but discarded the ideas of it being a brainwash or scam shortly after they came up. \n\nAfter I was convinced that the click could be very doable for me as well ( even with low self-esteem )I wrote down my life, including points which seemed relevant for building my emotional core. To reflect on this was pretty easy for me, since I adopted mindful meditation for the past 2years. I found that my core was safety, which later on I could translate further into comfort, which I had to adopt in my early childhood, to survive in a seemingly cruel and dangerous world. I came to realize that my life was negatively influenced by comfort from the very beginning, and that it has highly limited me in life. \n\nNow the problem I had is, that I was already trying to apply logic, on a rational level, for over a year. And my emotional trust in logic was still highly limited. But don’t get me wrong, I appreciated logic and always had the dream of helping others and making sense. I went to sleep shortly after writing down my life, because I heard clickers losing their click over night. I felt like I have to be mentally prepared and sharp in order to click.\n\nOn the next day I was trying to convince my inner child for the first time, that what it is holding on to is causing more pain and less safety. It felt like my inner child was still too afraid of logic to hold on to, even though I felt very emotional and in line towards letting go of comfort. (Btw imagining your inner child was an effective and helpful tool for me. I am reading a book about your “shadow child” which seems fairly interesting.) \n\nThe next day I got confronted with a lot of dissonance, when I had an unexpected visitor to eat dinner with, the new boyfriend of my sister. I felt a lot of dissonance at that time, went back to my room, sat down, and convinced my self to try again, even if I felt like my trust in logic might not be strong enough. I looked back to situations of my life where I had to trust logic and how I could master every situation logically, even when making mistakes and facing trouble doing so. \n\nThen I imagined again, how my inner child, (which I imagine as my former self when I was very young), hiding in the very corner under a staircase, afraid, holding on to a teddy-bear, which I imagined to be comfort. But at the same time, I was also trying to see my myself from the perspective of my inner child, looking at my present self, reaching out for my inner child, begging the child to cling onto logic and come out of the corner. This made me able to make the switch because it made me the most  emotional.\nThis time I felt relief, and a strong desire to start trust logic. Because I didn’t test my trust in logic too much in my daily life, I immediately put on some clothes and went outside, to proof myself that I can overcome fear and comfort and trust logic unconditionally. (It was like 8pm so it was cold and dark outside) I live near a forest at a mountain, so I walked up trough the forest just with a flashlight. I was walking for over 1hour, ending up at an open area in the woods, where I could look down to the next city when I randomly started laughing and smirking, which I could not understand at this very moment. I had a good feeling about having trust in logic and having made a \"leap of faith\" as athene calls it. The way down I did not even need to use my flashlight. \n\nThis story may sound silly, but It was a powerful practical option I had in this very moment, to experience a strong emotion, which allowed me to unlock my trust in logic. \n\nThis seems like an enormous wall of text for me already, I am sorry for that. \n\nBut I felt like my clicking process was not obvious nor flawless in any way. Because when I came home I immediately had to puke, because I apparently caught the flu, some day before at work. While recovering, I was worried about my experience fading away, and felt uncertainty cause I could not do anything logical besides recovering as fast as I could. When I was able to go on with my life normally again I was feeling driven, subconsciously, to do the most logical stuff. \nI could list a lot of things that I did, for example cleaning up my PC from all forms of distractions and useless shit in general which could waste my time. \n\n\nAfter realising some days later, that I did such actions without forcing myself to do so I was shocked. The past days when I was feeling sick I adopted the probability this just being a placebo. But when I felt euphoric about having clicked, I immediately started thinking:” Would someone that clicked even bother to find out if he truly clicked? Am I just trying to fit in?” Since I am very honest with myself, I found that answering the 3questions might be a legit thing to do, so I can share and help others. \n\nI didn’t cover the 4 steps well, but I will list just briefly what I experienced:\n\n1.\tAs a farmers son I always had a good connection to nature and appreciated the logic around us that have brought humanity this far. When I was questioning life around us I often got discouraged from doing so. What helped me to refresh and increase my interest and love for logic was watching some documentaries which I found on this subreddit. Including: *Nature by Numbers, Fractals - The Hidden Dimension, and the Great Math Mystery.*\n2.\tAs mentioned, I personally could restrict my core value better with writing down my childhood and young adulthood. Defining what your emotional core is, which drives everything you do in life, is probably the easiest, when you think about your childhood. Meditation helped me a lot to go deeper into clouded and suppressed feelings and stories.\n3.\tSwitching my core value was probably the hardest thing for me to do, creating dissonance for my current core value, comfort, was easy, yet making my inner child letting go of it and making it hold to a new one seemed really hard. I was listening to other people that tried and struggled with the same issue. I tried to meditate on this without big results. Even though I consider myself a sensitive guy, I had a hard time feeling warmth and safety in logic. What helped me is trying to get emotionally attached to the concept of logic. I first noticed this when arguing with my mother about the concept of clicking and making sense, I started out just with trying to explain why I felt like it is the most logical thing to do in life. When my mother started to argue about it with her subjective reality, which is conditioned, I noticed that I was getting emotionally invested and somehow felt that logic has become a new part of me. \n4.\tKeeping making sense feels like a drug to me, I started studying, reading a lot on the subreddit regarding this, changed my room to support a more logical approach, looking up recipe to cook healthy, living even healthier (sleeping more than 6-7h+ in my case), started working out again, quitted visiting social media, stopped playing games almost completely (as soon as I find myself playing WoW without the purpose of relaxing and connecting with friends for a bit I instantly feel strong dissonance), taking vitaminD3, and taking more responsibility overall. Everything unwinds itself subconsciously, I just stop myself consciously time to time and ask myself: “Is this the most logical thing I can do right now?” And of course, I still will face some deep rooted neural patterns in my brain which I have to rewire logically. Everything seems new and fresh, and I can reward myself at any given moment by making logical decisions. I do alot more than those things listed, also starting to read Real Answers and so forth. \n\nSorry for my grammar and writing format. I’m not used to write and never posted on reddit before.\nI thought sharing might be helpful or stimulating in any way for an individual that wants to click. \n\nKind of off-topic: Athene has been a big inspiration for me personally. And I'm really thankful for the privilege to have witnessed him doing his greatest work and he indeed changed my life for the better.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_MlSfxUddc this vid reminded me of it.\n","createdAt":1478728751,"score":8,"author":"Martoreal","id":"5c411e"},{"title":"Just clicked","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5bz064/just_clicked/","selftext":"Hey guys, I'm pretty sure I just clicked and thought I should share it with you guys hopefully it will help. \n\n\nA little bit about myself to start. So I'm 19 and from Canada, currently living in the United States however. I have quite a bit of social anxiety, and did not really live very healthy. I mostly found myself in my room most days, either playing video games or just watching dumb videos. I did not eat very healthy at all either, eating pizza and other crappy foods quite often, although I do work out regularly.\n\n\nI've followed Athene for a while, but I was kind of skeptical about this click stuff, especially when he mentioned the 4 steps, it originally sounded a lot like another typical self help guide. After seeing people actually get this stuff, I said hey you know what, this seems to be getting some people results so might as well try it.\n\n\nI've been trying to do this for the last four days or so, and I was really struggling with it on a lot of levels. I'll go through my process in order, even though I did a lot of back and forth between some of the steps.\n\n\n**Step One: Love Logic**\nIt turns out I really underestimated this step. This is super important guys, so don't leave this out. At first, I started by watching a few videos found [here](https://logicnation.org/wiki/Content_to_help_you_appreciate_logic#Reddit_Posts) to really help build my love for logic. I watched Nature by Numbers, Fractals - The Hidden Dimension, and the Great Math Mystery. These were the ones that really resonated and I thought did a lot for me, the other ones didn't do so much, but I recommend going through all of them because they will have different effects on different people. I watched these basically in my first couple of days, and scratched this number off my list because I really thought I had the full appreciation that I actually needed.\n\n\n**Step Two: Find Core Value**\nThis one was pretty easy for me, but I analyzed all my behaviors anyways to find out the truth. I figured out that on a fundamental level I really valued comfort, but also had a lot of validation seeking behaviors and the need for safety a lot of times. What I learned from watching some of Athene's calls with clickers, is that you should really focus on what the most dominant core value is in your life on a fundamental level. I noticed that for me, my validation and safety behaviors could really boil down to the need for comfort in general, so it's best to keep that in mind.\n\n\n**Step Three: Dissonance and Switch**\nThis one really gave me the most trouble, as I think it does for pretty much everybody. This took me several days to really get in contact with my emotions on a core level. Over the last few days, I've been thinking really hard about how this core value is really hurting my life, and I needed to change it. I read up on a lot of the other click stories, and found from reading about them that the rational approach doesn't work. I really didn't do much with the rational approach and tried to do it on a purely emotional level. In my day to day life, I really don't experience much dissonance, and I have been really lucky with my life so it was really hard to convince my core value that what it's holding onto is really flawed. A couple days ago, I was able to stir up quite some dissonance with my core value with the help of Zillean. I really reflected on this and meditated on how meaningless all my problems were in the grand scheme of things. I mean, there are people literally dying out there, and here I am being worried about what job I will get after college? I mean come on... You really need to put your problems into perspective on the grand scheme of things and really stir up some dissonance with this, it really helped me. \n\n\nEven though I did all this, and meditated on it, I was not able to make the click. However, I did notice that after this experience I was able to be a lot more aware the next day, a lot more social, and I was eating a lot healthier for no apparent reason. I found this really strange, because what I felt didn't really feel like the click, it was not what people were describing it as. I still found myself not really questioning things around me, and not really craving to understand everything. Why was this? \n\n\nIt was because I really did not love and appreciate logic on an emotional level yet. You really need to make sure you do the first step, super important. \n\n\nSo today, I found myself watching a few episodes of Cosmos for the first time. I really enjoyed them, and once again I tried to make the push tonight. I found myself listening a bit to some of the calls Athene had with other people to discuss their click stories. A few moments really resonated with me so I'll highlight them and talk a bit about what they did for me.\n\n\nI listened to him talk to someone working to be a clicker who had an issue understanding how logic could come from nothing. So, Athene presented his theory that logic came from infinite chaos. It made a lot of sense to me, and it seemed like the most probable scenario like he was saying it did. \n\n\nThe second moment that really resonated with me was him mentioning how happiness is coming from this person's desire for comfort, because comfort is connected to his reward center. \n\n\n[Infinite Chaos stuff - 4:32:00 ish](https://www.twitch.tv/athenelive/v/99649523)\n\n\n[Reward Center stuff - 4:47:00 ish](https://www.twitch.tv/athenelive/v/99649523) \n\n\nI really thought about and reflected about these two things. On one hand, having a really strong appreciation with how all this came from seeming chaos is just amazing. I found this mind boggling, and it really kind of boosted my love for logic in this moment. On the other hand, I thought about how comfort being connected to my reward center is bringing me happiness, and switching it with logic would give me much more happiness. I would suddenly be happy a lot more, because I would be able to appreciate everything around me a lot more, because everything is is brought about through logic.\n\n\nThese moments were really creating some strong emotions with me so I took this moment to really think about all of this. I really felt a strong connection to the Nature by Numbers video when I first watched it, so quickly while these emotions were running through my head I threw on the video. The music, the thoughts, and everything was really coming together in the moment. I was really feeling the love and appreciation for everything while realizing that I am missing out on so much happiness by having comfort as my core value instead of logic. Then, before I knew it, when the flower popped up with with all those seeds coming from the golden angle, everything clicked. I was in tears, I had a true appreciation for everything in this world, and how lucky we all are to be a part of it. I felt amazing, I was laughing, and crying, and looking around my room with complete awe. I felt fully awake, and since I was feeling hungry before, my hunger seemed to completely disappear and I felt completely in the moment. \n\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, I went into the discord and told some other clickers about this. Normally I would not have been able to do it at all, because of my social anxiety, I was able to jump right in without any cares at all. Although I was fumbling through my words quite a bit due to excitement :) I'm sure because of this my social anxiety will eventually disappear completely.\n\n\nSo yeah, that was my story. It was pretty amazing, this shit is real guys. It may be really hard, but you have to push for it, it will change your life. Even without the click the last couple of days have been way better, so I can't imagine what it will be like now that I have clicked. Really push for it, and I think eating healthy and working out probably has huge effects for being able to focus on your emotions a lot more, so make sure you have that in check when you are trying to do this stuff. I think this was probably huge in helping me out tonight. Also one last thing, I don't know if this had any effect or not, but I'll mention it anyways: you have to really WANT to click, like really, really want to click more than anything. I found myself today and yesterday, pretty much thinking about this stuff all day. It may help to have this stuff really a part of your awareness, although I'm not sure, may need some other people to verify this to be sure.\n\n\nSorry for the probably bad reddit formatting, I don't use it too often. \n\n\nHope this helped some of you guys, if you have any question feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer.

And his inspiring words made me think and brought me on track again which in the end made me click and resolved my depressions.\nA little bit about my past: Let’s start in my early childhood. I had the privilege to get raised very kindly. Especially my father always guided me towards helping others and turning my back to those who wanted to provoke me. And yes I always had a hard time finding acceptance. I had my very best friends and that was it. I never was that kind of kid that was in the centre of everything and had problems in bigger groups. The older ones often saw a victim in me and my father had to help me a lot with those problems. I guess that is where I learned a lot of my social behaviour of helping those who need it.\nOnly when i played with my legos and learned about Pirates and other stuff from my nice books I found my peace and forgot everything around me...later it was playing Games.\nI always had that drive to know everything. I always asked “why” until the adults gave the answer \"just because\" and I never liked it. They even stated sometimes I shouldn’t ask that much which made ma kinda sad. \nIn my first years of school I had the luck to be educated by my mother in a school with an alternative structure where you had to organise yourself. After that I came into another school. That’s when my interest for new things slowed down and I felt misunderstood by my teachers. I suddenly I had a hard time to motivate me for anything. That’s where my life got out of control and until now I couldn’t find my drive anymore.\n\nBut 2 weeks ago I stumbled over one of Athenes videos again and started to think since it made quite some sense to me and answered many things I discuss with my friends when sitting together. I immediately noticed that there is something reasonable to it and I tuned into the stream hearing about the click thing. At first I wasn’t that much interested cause I knew the old HYPED stream and it was kind of boring but I could relate a bit to it so I left it on while doing stuff in my flat. By accident I suddenly noticed a lot of things I could so much relate to. Then Athene was mentioning the podcasts (which I knew they existed but didn’t know what they were all about). Since I could relate to all of the points about the click I thought I would give it a shot and started Podcast#1.\nI immediately noticed the importance of the podcasts and could understand every point he made. My problems started to fade away as I understood the essence of all of them and in one of them he talked about God is in the neurons. I watched it and everything started to even make more sense. Suddenly I could break down every situation in my past on the basis of the fundamental knowledge of the podcasts and the documentary. I could relate to everything and understood everything...like literally.\nFrom that point on my life was skyrocketing (and I knew that this has to do with the click, if it is not the click himself yet). I did things I could never do(decision-making) I was not guided by my fears anymore. The idea of myself as an introverted person was gone...the idea of myself as a person was gone. Everything made sense.\nAt first I had issues every morning to get into it again...I started a podcast and everything made sense again. I told my closest friends cause I thought they got to know it and they would listen...the didn’t. But I know their reasons and I move on as I know their time will come...contact even slowed down a bit but I reach out bigger things today. I is now so easy to move on...something I never could.\nUntil that point I was always questioning myself if that is the click. I mediated a lot on it and tuned into the stream again yesterday to listen to while doing stuff. A guy from America was calling(recorded I think). Everything this guy said was what I had experienced...like every word. I had to sit down and a euphoria rushed my body as I realised I really clicked. Then I got to the Wiki and the \"symptoms\" list made me smile and fuelled the rush in my head even more.\n\nThank you for the inspiration...making sense is great.","createdAt":1478643839,"score":4,"author":"logic_overall","id":"5bwf19"},{"title":"Don't know you clicked till it's gone(sorta)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5bxcgk/dont_know_you_clicked_till_its_gonesorta/","selftext":"For along time I wanted to be a story writer but I never did much writing. You hear about this all the time from people who aspire to be writers but just cant seem to find themselves doing much to get started. So I thought maybe I was just some creative flower waiting to bloom or something(maybe with enough drugs). However a part of me wanted to do things such as Digital Media(video editing), or programming. There is just something about sitting at a computer writing out a code that just kinda grabs me. Weird. While I could learn it all on my own, I didn't feel it would be worth it if it didn't land me a job somewhere. To get a job in programming I would need to take Computer Science as a major, but I always scratched majors like these off the list due to how much math they required. I'm taking a basic College Algebra course right now and a part of me is just losing my mind. I actually just began cheating and told myself it was because I would never use it again so it didn't matter.\n\nSo that's the back story. Heres the last few days. I love playing video games online and I was beginning to lose my interest in writing. I had held on to the dream for so long that it would be a major blow to my emotional well being to let it go. So I thought. As I said, I love playing video games and I started wondering if  there was any kind of study over games and game strategies. Turns out yes, Game Theory. Game Theory is used in quite a few areas but I mostly heard about it in Economics. Ok, so maybe I take Economics? It really didn't sound bad. About a year ago I got into the stock market and lost $600(if you heard about VRX dropping like a ton of bricks, I was one of those poor suckers), but to this day I still don't really regret it. It was a lot of fun actually, reading business news, tracking their progress and trying to determine where they might stand in the market the next day. It really was like a game of some sort, the lost money was nothing more to me than lost points, which is weird because I'm terrified of being poor.\nSo cool, Economics, lets look at the degree plan- oh look, math math math. Ok I think. Fuck it. Fuck writing. Fuck living a secluded indoor life. I was going to try for it. So I needed to get better at math, and that meant I needed to be enthusiastic about math. So what do I find? Athens video. I forgot exactly what web surfing rout I took to get there, but I got there. I was hesitant at first. It sounded cool but also a little bit New Age cult like. But I still listened to his whole video since I was to lazy to find which internet tab out of twenty was the video playing. Small things started to shift in my mind. Even now it's hard to explain what caused it. Talks about making logic the center of your mind and not listening to the child inside of you, which is exactly what I had been doing. Purposely actually. I thought doing so somehow made me more creative. Suddenly I found myself making new plans for my life. I was going to take Computer Science(it changed from economics) but I was going to start off by taking it one class at a time until I felt comfortable with adding more or I had them all out of the way. For some reason I no longer wanted the \"highlight\" time of my life to be instant, I told myself I could wait. The video had ended about an hour ago but I was still thinking about the whole \"click\" thing. Was I clicking? I had done this before where I suddenly had a clear vision of how to live my life but it soon disappeared. I went to bed later and woke up the next day to start on my school work. Some part of me still had it, I was clicked. The day went on and I did my online courses without once tabbing out to play a video game. Probably because I had actually put playing video games on my to do list. I wasn't just going to run around on Overwatch just playing till it got boring 5 hours ago. I realized that all the characters in this game and their weapons had specific stats and that based on those numbers I could come up with a no shit mathematical strategy. I wasn't really happy, nor upset, I was just doing things. But after a while something started to shift back and I could realize it. There was something really different this time. I felt myself getting more and more angry. I couldn't understand it. I was at my computer doing my work and I just wanted to hit something for no reason. I decided that I should use this unexplained energy to go back to the gym, but while I was there I found myself directing my anger at the people. Not directly, just in my mind. I was increasingly more and more angry. I decided that I should just sleep it off, so I went home, did a little more work and went to bed, but I couldn't sleep. Soon the anger turned into overwhelming fear. And this was it- I was suddenly terrified that I may have had an STD. Yep. Sexually Transmitted Disease. In my past I had quite a few sexual encounters with questionable people. the encounters were almost completely low risk to no risk(condoms on or it was just a form of oral) but I couldn't shake the fear. At 4am I bought a blood test appointment at a near by clinic and would go there tomorrow. My mind finally permitted me to sleep. When I woke up I felt silly. At the moment I no longer had a fear of dying by STD(its not the dying part btw, it's the I can never have a family part) but shortly after the fear came back. I went to get my test and now I have to wait 1-2 days. I'm not really too nervous now but for some reason I still cant get back into my studies. I have quite a few important things due soon and I just can't find myself to do it the same way I was doing it two days ago. For some reason it doesn't feel worth it if I'm going to die by STD (this is the part where the fear of death comes in) and it is just STD. Death by any other health issue doesn't feel like as big an obstacle to push through. I'm confused, angry, tired, stressed, and alone feeling and I'm having a shit time processing it. I just want to get back to what ever \"click\" like feeling I had.\n\n*edit* sorry I think the title was misleading.

I also used most of my free time to play WoW. I was very lazy. I considered myself as quite intelligent. Therefore I thought I didn´t have to do much for university. \n\nI found out about clicking on monday last week (31.10.). So many doubts came into my mind. But it was somehow very interesting to hear the expieriences of people who clicked. On tuesday I listened to some of the realtalk podcasts for the first time. Espacially the confrontational one (#51) hit me really hard.\n\nI soon realized that my core value was comfort. Nevertheless many doubts were still rising in my head. I first wanted to ask Athene via the twitch chat but I saw that many people were having the same doubts I had. The Sentence that got me was: \"Dont ask me these Questions, ask yourself WHY are you asking these Questions.\" \nI meditated on that for about two hours and I came to the conclusion that all these doubts were emotionally driven and that my core value was having problems keeping up the \"confort zone\" as an oasis of rewards for me. So that was when I really focused on making the click. \n\nTo love logic was not a problem for me, as I enjoyed programming and already knew that there is always a logical reason behind everything. \n\nLike I ve said I already found out my core value so I was left with step three. I started with a rational approach:\n \n* I wrote down all the cons of having comfort as my core value\n* I meditated and told myself what I wrote down.\n\nThis approach had no effect at all.\nThen I read the LogicWiki.\n\n**It is a process on an emotional, subconscious level.**\n\nAs I review on this I can say that it is much easier if you are aware of your emotions first.\nAsk yourself why you feel what you feel in a given moment. If you do that, you will recognize certain emotions when they emerge and you know where they come from.\nIf this awareness grows big enough (it took me roughly one day),  it is much easier to go on that layer with your emotions and confront your inner child with your awareness. I think awareness is the key here. This was by far the most difficult thing for me to do but I think the 4. Step will be as hard or even harder. \n\nAs I was meditating on giving my core value a hard time staying, I was shaking and I felt several \"shocks\" going through my body.\nI went to sleep shortly after, because I had to attend a class early next day.\nThe school day was pretty normal except that I was solving the tasks me and my partner had so fast that he couldnt catch up. I thought it was the result of me being more aware and in the moment.\nWhen I came home I started my pc as usual. But I felt so much dissonance starting WoW. I asked myself: \"What is the reason of me playing that game?\" I could not find a logical answer. So I quit Wow instantly. As a result of asking myself these questions, I now:\n\n* Stoped playing games \n* Stoped watching any kind of entertainment related material\n* Eat healthier\n* Clean up my room regulary\n* Stoped drinking alkohol and coffee\n* Do not feel the need to go to partys\n\nThis list goes on, but some of the things I could add might not be interesting or are too detailed/private.\nI never thought I ve clicked really. I thought I just had a big boost of awareness and the click is yet to come. Just today\nI answered myself the three questions. And I was surprised that my answer to all these three was yes.

This also means that you are your environement and that *nothing is external*. \n\nThis insight has drastic consequences that point to the fact that you will be far more connected to other people than with any other believe system:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Knowing that your environement is part of you, you will automatically search for a stimulating environement with people that are like minded. You will learn from those people and they will learn from you, making everyone grow more. This will create a friendship that is based on very fundamental believes, which give stronger bonds that are less reliable on external factors.\n\n* Without a strong (flawed) identity you will be more capable to *truely listen* to people. Because you are not emotionally attached to your own believes, they will not stand in the way to really understand the other person from his own perspective. This creates a very nice and friendly atmosphere where both you and the person you talk with to will feel understood and appreciated. This atmosphere will also make it much easier to learn from one another.\n\n* You will have almost no arguments that endlessly keep on going without anyone learning anything. Because those kind of arguments usually arise when people don't truely listen to each other or if they feel their believes are being threatened.\n\n* Because you will be more capable to look through the eyes of another person (truely listening), miscommunication will be much less probable to occur. You will be much more aware that different people have different ideas and emotions attached to concepts.\n\n* With the insight that you are for a big part your environement, you will take care of your environement more, as much as you take care of yourself. You will help others in your environement more easily, creating an educative and stimulating vibe. You will try to make other people their problems your own in order to get to a solution more quickly.\n\n* Your circle of influence increases drastically. Because your actions are more targeted at stimulating your environement, your actions will more easily ripple through and beyond your direct environement.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll these concequences can be traced back to the insight that you are your environement, that nothing is external. By adopting this insight and really internalizing it, these consequences *will* take place. They will make your social life healthier, more stimulating and much more fulfilling.\n\nI tried to point out that clicking does not result in a cold and neutral social life, but quite the opposite.

Any related questions will be answered and any tips will be taken serious.  \n**Introduction**  \nIf have been active on the Stream quite some while, but only the last couple of months I started to listen to the realtalk podcast. The first podcast that had an impact ( if you want to call it that) had a topic about how you can change your thinking can be adjusted. Like people who have a mental depression can get better at feeling depressed, but it also works the other way around. (podcast number 22) This changed my thinking pattern quite some at that time.  That is the time where I went some deeper into the real talk and re-listened them all, for at that time there was a small break in the making of new podcasts. I looked up a lot of the things that were mentioned and started to act. The first thing I did was working out on a weekly basis. At the time, I also got a better sleep rhythm and started to eat less meat, back to 2-3 times a week.  \n**Fine tuning**  \nAlthough I followed to real talk ever since I never had the complete devotion to go all the way. But I was still curious and went to get the book “the power of now” and started to read in that. It has some good practical ways to get you in the now and get you more aware. I started to use meditation at this point. Around the time I finished the book I started to realize that there was more to the real talk then I originally thought. The points Athene made came a cross in multiple ways with the book in a more scientific way than spiritual as the book intents. As being a bit critical of some kind of god (in a religious way) I liked the more scientific approach. Soon after I picked up Athene’s book “ real answers” \nAround the time podcast 45 I started to hit a wall. I found my core value (comfort) but I couldn’t get emotional with logic. Around this time, I started to become fed-up sometimes why I could not have this click that other people would seems to have. What was I doing wrong?\nAfter this I also started to watch a series called “ Cosmos” (2014) as I already had some connection with logic I really liked the series. Specially the last episode.  \n**Click?**  \nI found out that was already using more logic in everything I did, so I did sense I trusted it more as I worked with it to explained flawed behavior and change it around to some extent.\nNow after all this I will come to the point of where it just kind of happened, I was traveling to work and listening to podcast number 53. And some times when I hear there is more to it but I can’t fully absorb it, I would go back to it some other time. In this case the next day. This explained very clearly how to trust and love logic as if it is a god. After this I meditated on that until I got I said to myself “ I don’t have to trust in myself anymore” And in just a fraction of time everything changed. I Experienced great relieve and started to make all kinds of connections. Like” why even drink alcohol, I don’t need that” or “why even eat meat, there are so much other options and it makes no sense to do so” these where not only thoughts but I experienced it as a must. Things you can’t deny. I have a great Euphoric feeling specially the first day. But I still am happy for no specific reason. I start to notice how the world seem to have more depth as if a gray filter was removed from my eyes and started to see how beautiful everything is.\nI also noticed that I confidence grew and I was not scared anymore of what people would think of me.\nNow I only have experienced this 3 days as I write this so I can understand you could be sceptic. But I can tell you that so far I had no urge to do anything illogical.  \n**Currently**  \nShortly after my experience I had a talk with Athene on skype to discuss my state of mind, he was thinking I might only have had Identity death, but as I also want to do logical things It does not seem like it. I will continue to build my trust in logic like the logicnation.org website says.  \nSo What I would like to ask is, What do Clickers think of this experience, is it like what other people go through. And if you think I have not clicked what is your best explanation for it?\n Like I said, I am here to learn and share so please share your experience and idea’s so other people might be able to use it as well.  \nNow you can see the steps I took to get where I am and I hope it can help some people. It might be good to see how my entire process went and not just a simple Q&amp;A structure.\n","createdAt":1478472977,"score":11,"author":"SkadiLive","id":"5binw2"},{"title":"Inspirational texts to develop an unconditional trust in logic","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5bfbn5/inspirational_texts_to_develop_an_unconditional/","selftext":"Hey guys, Fabio from crew here. These scripts will be improved over time but I will post them because it might help some people to connect emotionally to logic.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe often take everything we have today for granted and we don’t realize how none of it would have been possible without logic.\n\nOur comfy homes, our dreams, our loved ones, the things we appreciate, this amazing ride we call life.\n\nIt might sound difficult to grasp, but if it wasn’t for our ability to understand and use logic in our benefit, the world as we know today would never exist.  \n\nTechnology completely transformed our lives. New vaccines gifted a lot of children with the opportunity to go past their first birthday. The Internet took us into a new world of unlimited access to knowledge, something that Einstein or our grandparents were never lucky to have. \n\nHow many bursts of laughter did we share and how many tears did we cry while talking through a screen? How many times did we find comfort in movies, series and video games? \n\nEntertainment and well-being, only possible due to our understanding of one simple equation: The Second Law of Motion.\n\nThe chain reaction caused by this equation was fundamental to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and the start of the modern age.\n\nWe live in a time with the lowest global rates of violent crime. A time in which death because of war and starvation is much less likely to occur.\n\nIf we don’t have to work as a slave or raise children in a dangerous environment. If we don’t have to suppress our opinions and live a life told by others. If we don’t have to fear any of that, it’s only because of our understanding of logic.\n\nIf we could choose to be reborn at any moment in history, we should choose right now. Logic made the world a better place and without it, all the safety and comfort that we enjoy today would be nothing more than a dream.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNature. \n\nBits of dazzling wonder that have been inhabiting our world long before the 1st human species set foot on Earth. Out there. Amazing us with simple, yet magnificent silhouettes. \n\nAt first sight, it may seem hard to believe how simple logical patterns can lie beneath such seemingly chaos. \n\nSome scientists set forth the notion that Nature was ruled by a different kind of mathematics, outside of the realm of the one created by us. It was called fractal geometry where each individual component of a certain object or living thing had the same pattern as the whole. Fractal geometry revealed an underlying order in Nature governed by simple mathematical rules. \n\nMost scientists never gave too much thought to this hypothesis. It wasn’t until the movie industry began to use fractal geometry to produce stunning and realistic computer graphics of landscapes and natural phenomena – such as hurricanes and volcano lava – that mathematicians began to realize how logic could also be found in the gracious, complex shapes of nature.\n\nMountains, clouds, rivers. Animals and their architecture, plants and their petals. From a Nautilus shell to the cosmos, a myriad of simple mathematical patterns translated into complex organisms. Translated into glaring beauty...  \n\nTrees and plants growing in spiral rotations so that new leaves don’t block the sun from older ones and together they can maximize the amount of rain directed to the roots. Trees, the lungs of the Earth and the engineers of Oxygen, 2 atoms in which our existence is built upon.\n\nLife blooming on the grounds of natural selection, selecting mathematical characteristics that allowed nature and humans to thrive. That allowed us to love, hate, cry and laugh. Allowed us… to live.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLogic is the stepping stone behind all the delicate feelings that we most cherish in our life, from paintings to music, from being in love with someone to the sweet connection between mother and child.\n \nEven though music is a big part of our lives and we find great meaning and beauty in it, we weren’t the ones that really created it. Music is a phenomenon of nature, a result of mathematical principles that we use to mold and reorganize unsynchronized sounds into gentle melodies. It’s our logical understanding of these patterns that allow us to find comfort and inspiration in our favorite songs. \n\nBeauty is a property that we can’t help but feel drawn to but what makes it so special? Why is often a pretty face or a sculptured body the center of attention? \n\nPerceiving beauty in others and feeling attracted to them is a natural consequence of an evolutionary mechanism that drives us to reproduce and pass our genes to the next generation.\n\nBeauty emerges from the mathematical patterns that natural selection elected as the most attractive. The fact that patterns present in a beautiful face can also be found in Nature clearly describes how we are not attracted to beauty itself but rather to the mathematical patterns that bring beauty about.\n\nNot only that, but chemicals such as dopamine and oxytocin were finely tuned during evolution to be released in our brain at the right time, in the right portion, just to hit the exact mark in which we completely fall in love. \n\nThis happens not only in romantic couples but also in maternal bonding.  The same chemicals are released in the brain during pregnancy strengthening the love and affection a mother has for her child.\n\nLove is a mathematical equation that has been forged in the deep intricacies of evolution. One that combines beautiful patterns and chemical attraction in the exact amounts to produce this ecstatic, blissful feeling we call “love”.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNot only technology, nature and our external body are composed of mathematical patterns. If we look inwards, we find a myriad of complex systems formed by simple logical patterns. \n\nLungs, kidneys, blood vessels, the brain, our DNA, our heartbeats... \n\nAs an example, if it wasn’t for our ability to identify irregularities in our heartbeats, we would have a hard time to detect underlying cardiac problems. In the same way, if it wasn’t for the ability to observe how cancer cells multiply in a different, disorganized way, we would have almost no chance of surviving. \n\nHumans work as a congruent system of organs in which out of the ordinary patterns that go against our in-built mathematical nature are detrimental to our existence. This logical understanding is what might give doctors, one day, the ability to save our life.\n","createdAt":1478431735,"score":30,"author":"hateramos","id":"5bfbn5"},{"title":"Keep trying","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5bg1y6/keep_trying/","selftext":"I have had moments in life where I chose to think what other people thought - when I was small and today. I tell myself not to bother, because it does NOT matter what other people think about me. But that did not help, and it showed me that **the emotional level is way above the rational one**. If I want to become an emotional being attached to logic as my core value, I need to be **honest with myself**. Find my true core value and expose its flawed concept and replace it with logic. This is the only way I can become a new person, a better person, more logical and in line with what I truly am, however, **I seem to struggle with either finding my true core value or switching it out with logic**. Going through my past, I have noticed that **validation and comfort** seem to be what drives me on an emotional level. In order for me to get things done, I have throughout my life disciplined myself and looked for intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to keep doing what I think is the ‘right’ thing to do. I am aware that there is no such a thing as right or wrong, rather just logical thing to do that my current knowledge supports. I keep pushing myself to become a better person, also one of the reasons why the 'Real Talk' podcasts have resonated with me. Before the ‘click’ period started, I saw Bashir as a smart guy who spent a lot of time researching and was very disciplined. After the ‘click’ period, it made a lot more sense that he could be so productive, insightful and progressive, because he had logic as his core value. He had less dissonance in terms of duality in his mind, which has been screwing me over my entire life, and since I did not see this before, I was doomed to think very little of it. However, NOW I understand how the puzzle is connected and I have been trying to make the ‘click’. As mentioned above, my current core value keeps playing games with me and deflects everything I throw at it. Why? Because **I underestimated the power of the emotions we humans have** and what they can do to you, if you don’t fully understand them. Another lesson I learned, **don’t ever suppress your emotions, embrace them and reflect on them.** By suppressing you TRULY become this stereotypical cold logical person everyone is afraid of becoming (incl. me until recently). Observing Bashir and many other crew members such as Dreese and Ricardo showed that they are still warm and thoughtful people. I truly am thankful for being alive during these times to witness and get inspired by people who dear to challenge the way we go about our lives. Again, embrace it and reflect on it, then it can become part of you and use it to ‘click’ into logic as your core emotional value that drives you every day!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nEven though I have not managed to make logic my core emotional value yet, I still learned new things about myself, which is very crucial in order to understand this transition. Therefore, I will keep pushing until I get there as this is a journey between me and what I truly am, and thus worth going through. \n","createdAt":1478443737,"score":10,"author":"BugShot","id":"5bg1y6"},{"title":"How I clicked","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5bbs3q/how_i_clicked/","selftext":"**How I changed from being anxious about almost everything to being confident and in the present all the time overnight**\n\nHi I'm 20 years old from Germany and just joined the crew. I managed to click a few weeks ago.\nMy life before the click was usually me sitting in my room procrastinating and watching videos. I didn't saw much meaning in my life, so my drive to do stuff was mainly dictated by the amount of motivational videos I watched at that time. \nMy room was my comfort bubble where I could feel safe and don't have to worry about anything.\nDoing the four steps this completely changed.\n\n**First Step: Trusting in Logic**\nThe first step for me was already done by listening to the realtalks over the years. I developed a good understanding about what logic can actually do and how it could change my life. What I mainly did was, connecting good emotions to logic. For example, the feeling of achieving anything I want, I connected that to logic. This in combination with the trust that everything makes sense, completed step one for me.\n\n**Second Step: Finding out the core value**\nThe second step was a bit harder to do. I had to figure out what really drives me on an emotional level. In order to do so I had to look at events in my past and ask myself why I did what I did. I basically found out that my core value was fitting in, which then changed over time to comfort. I could see that comfort was my core value, because I was mainly sitting in my room and watching series. I also only could really feel safe in my room.\n\n**Third Step: Changing the core value to logic**\nThe third step took only about half an hour and began in my room by trying to create dissonance. I picked up events in my past where I screwed up or was really ashamed of myself and confronted myself constantly with them. When I created a lot of dissonance, I tried to switch to logic. I imagined that logic would be my savior and really focused on the emotion I had connected to logic. I repeated the sentence “Everything makes sense” over and over again, because I had strong emotions connected to it. I did this until I hit the point where these strong emotions would stay. \nMy body was shaking a little bit and strong positive emotions would rush in my body. That's when I switched to logic as my core value.  \n\n**Fourth Step: Doing logical things**\nThis may be interesting for the people who clicked. After the initial hype I did fall a little bit back in my old habits. For example I first wanted to have a talk to Athene on stream, but my brain was still skeptical about my confidence. In the end I didn't call and after the stream was over I felt dissonance like never before.\nI did an illogical thing by not talking on the stream.  I was panicking, sweating and almost wanted to puke, because the dissonance was so bad. After 20 minutes I realized that I could just argue with myself about my dissonance, because it doesn't make sense to feel so much dissonance for such a long period of time. It makes more sense to feel good and do it better next time. You basically just learn from the experience and move on. After that the dissonance was completely gone and I talked on the stream the next day. So whenever you do “illogical” stuff, don't beat yourself up over it and just try to learn from it, so you won't make the same mistake again.\nWhat helped me with building trust in logic was to solve problems using logic. If there are things you don't understand, trying to tackle them structured and logically will further strengthen your trust in it. Also seeing logic as a friend who is always there for you may deepen your trust.","createdAt":1478375552,"score":15,"author":"MetaTheMeta","id":"5bbs3q"},{"title":"Might have clicked but lost it after I fell asleep","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5bbp33/might_have_clicked_but_lost_it_after_i_fell_asleep/","selftext":"I might have clicked yesterday for an hour and then unclicked after I fell asleep.

My whole life I used to rationalize bad emotions and tell myself I don't have to be affected by them. It helped me to cope with dissonance but the consequence was a lot of suppressed emotions. Even when I had to admit to myself that I have low self-esteem I noticed how I experienced a lot of dissonance but it vanished fast. I saw myself saying to me that this is in my past, that I'm still a good person or that I try my best to make the click. Its really hard to distinguish between if emotions are suppressed or if they were just not there. Maybe I just didn't care so much about my low self-esteem, if comfort makes me do useless stuff or if I’m not my best self. But when I realized that this might be just my inner child suppressing emotions or my low self-esteem telling me I can’t be a strong person I wanted to fix it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was thinking about it. „the click is going to make me a better and stronger person, it will give me the most safety and it will unleash my full potential. Overall it is the best think I can do for myself. That my comfort doesn't want the best for me or that I settle with „confident enough“ doesn't make any sense. Which means the reason I don't experience dissonance about how much comfort harms me is because I suppress it. The reason I don't have the drive to become a confident strong person that can take care of business is because my low self esteem tells me I can’t become it anyway.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI realized that these are the things that hold me back and I have to fix them.\n\n\n\nI asked myself  „what emotion would I feel about me having low self-esteem?“ what emotion would I feel if  I wanted to become this strong person?“ \n\n\nOnce I knew  that I would feel pretty bad about having low self-esteem and that I would be motivated about becoming the best version of myself I knew which emotions are suppressed or, compromised on by low self-esteem.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI told myself that this is just a core value, just a deep flawed believe I have and that it’s not real. I don't have to give it any power and I can overcome it all. I went through it once at a time. „why don't I feel bad about wasting time on mindless entertainment? I should feel bad“. I tried as hard as possible to experience this emotion, to generate it! Because I knew the only reason I don't experience this emotion is because it is being suppressed right now. „why don't I have the drive to become the most confident, strong and self-reliable person I can? I should want this“. Again, I tried as hard as possible to imagine my self being this invincible guy that always knows what to do, and I made myself want it emotionally because I knew the only reason I don’t experience this emotion is because of my low self-esteem.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI spent a lot of energy on this process but after hours and days past I saw myself more and more in contact with my inner self. It was as if I finally was able to see it for what it is without the layers of suppressed emotions and identity.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNo matter why, if you act against your own interests you know that its the reason of a flawed believe. If you don’t experience emotions about acting against your interest its also because of a flawed believe. If you find out what emotion you are suppressing or what emotions you don’t trust yourself to have, you know what emotions you have to bring up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nthe rest of my click story you can read here\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5acr7a/how_i_clickedstas/","createdAt":1478288803,"score":16,"author":"Concasser","id":"5b5rha"},{"title":"My experience","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5b6of9/my_experience/","selftext":"Hello Everyone,\n\nSo I made the click, and will tell you my experience in the most compact way possible. (English isn't my native language btw.)\n\nEven though I always thought I \"loved\" logic I really didn't. Thinking that I loved logic wasn't that bad though because it acted as a bridge and helped me to stay focused on making the click. (When you make the click you realy understand \n(&amp; feel) the concept of loving logic on an emotional level, instead of an rational one)\n\nBasicly I tried to find my corevalue because I thought i already loved logic. After Athene pointed out that we have to find our core on an emotional level, i thought about ways to get realy emotional. I know that everyone requires different stimulation to enter an emotional state, and for me it was music (Which is the case for alot of people in my opinion). To be realy honest here, before making the click I didn't know why it made me emotional (I will come back to music a bit later).\n\nTo continue, I found my corevalue by going REALY deep, questioning every dicision I made, and came to the conclusion that all my life I was looking for acceptance and validation. I was TOTALLY sure this has to be it. The fact that I wasnt able to grasp the concept of clicking (What happens when you experience a paradigmshift) confused me, it didn't make any sense because I felt the same as before (maybe a bit worse because of dissonance). Only after clicking I understood that the reason for not understanding was my lack of logic and making sense. All these patterns weren't visible for me because i asked myself the wrong questions.\n\nOn the same day though, Athene posted a list of dokus to watch to strenghen your love for logic. I knew he postet them before, but i thought I already love logic, which in the end wasn't the case. I realy tricked and limited myself by thinking that. Please people, Step 1 is so important! \n\nSo I basicly watched \"the hidden dimension\" and the one with Math in the title (I don't remeber the name, but will look it up for you if you're interested), and that's where the click happend. from one moment to the other I changed. Everything made sense instantaneously. I could always find patterns in life, but now I know I CAN explain them with logic. this kind of emotionaly understanding and appreciation for all the patterns in nature was like a sensation. The fact that we are moving forward as a species because of logic. Even the question about music, which made me emotionally in the first place was much easier to understand. I could realy break down music bit by bit. Seeing notepatterns, seeing frequenciepatterns and realy seeing it for what it is. \n\nThis changed my life man... I see everything from a new point of view. I realy want to find an answer to everything and I KNOW logic will provide it. Every action I do I question now and don't take anything for granted. Everyone who didn't click realy doesn't know what he's missing out on. You realy have to realize that once you clicked, nothing is going to stop you. \n\nI used to smoke and stoped immediately. Actually I had a lot of bad habbits that weren't even able to cause dissonance after clicking because I droped them instantly. Everything that doesn't make any sense gets deleted, gets labeled as bad and vanishes automaticly. All the things you struggle with guys... you have to realize that there is no struggle or difficulty as soon as logic is your corevalue.\n\nThe moment you click, you feel so powerful. I wasn't even able to sleep because my brain automaticly worked so hard on overwriting everything that wasn't logical. I realy had to thank Athene this night for showing me the light...\n\nPlease guys keep trying to click... It's real and it will definetly change the world as we know it.\n\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1478298498,"score":8,"author":"Mayson1991","id":"5b6of9"},{"title":"Logic &gt; NoFap","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5b6oht/logic_nofap/","selftext":"After working on step four for quite some time, doing logical decisions to strengthen trust in logic everyday and every moment, now I don't feel the urge to watch porn anymore.

This is gonna be a very long post of how i went through the click - falling back and reclick process, with everything i learned and hopefully its gonna help some of you going through the process.\n\n\n**1. First click**\n\nI clicked first time two weeks ago. The drive was mostly to fit in with the group and i tried to force myself really hard to adopt logic. I thought my core value was fitting in and i debunked it, and when i went to my inner child i tried to make him see how logic will take care of him but i just didnt have enough positive emotions connected to it. I started looking at my past and debunking my identity, seeing how its just a story, a defensive mechanism to deal with fear, how its not what i am. I started feeling void inside me.\n\nAs i dig deeper i started to ask myself the question “why?”\n\nWhy do i have the need to fit in? Because im afraid to be rejected.\n\nWhy are you afraid? What exactly are you afraid of? Death\n\nWho is going to die? Obviously you are not your identity or story, so who is going to die?\n\nWho are you?\n\nWho is asking the question?\n\n**Logic!**\n\n**You are just logic trying to understand itself!**\n\n\nOnce i realized this it gave me a catharsis. At that moment my self-image changed from identity to logic and since i was already feeling void, my core value switched to logic. It was the happiest and most exciting moment in my life. I finally felt free , got a ton of confidence and my fears didnt affect me at all.\n\n**2. Unclick**\n\nAt that night i was thinking how my fears were finally over, how i can live in peace now and just follow logic. My brain was on fire, rethinking pretty much everything i came up with.\nIn the morning i was feeling numb as i didnt sleep much. And because of that my rational part was not as active and i started feeling those old emotions and fears again. And because i believed i will not experience them anymore , it started causing tremendous dissonance. “Why do i feel this way? Shouldn’t this be over, shouldnt i be at peace? I dont understand! What if this didnt work? What if i didnt click?”\nThe doubt started becoming worse and worse , since i didnt develop strong trust in logic before the click. I started getting fear of rejection: “I clicked and now im gonna say that i didnt, im gonna get rejected and kicked out” . Doubts and fears were overwhelming me and i started feeling void again, i let go of logic and fitting in and got all the way back into my comfort bubble.\n\n\n**What i learned from this process:**\n\n* **Old fears can still be there and you need to give yourself time to restructure them logically.**\n\n* **Make sure to first build trust in logic if its low by doing what’s most logical and only after that start tackling harder emotions and traumas. Answering questions, debating myself and building framework helped me with that.**\n\n\n**3. Re-Click**\n\n\nGetting back into it was much harder. First thing i was working on was developing trust in logic. Watching documentaries helped a lot, seeing how everything is built on mathematical patterns, how logic gives the structure to our reality, how everything happens for a reason and can be explained. \nI realized that the reason why we evolved to where we are today, why we have all this technology: pc, games, phones , cars are all because we started understanding logic. Our drive to understand logic is what brought all the richness we have today and is going to make us progress far beyond our imagination.\n\n\nI figured even all my thoughts , emotions and actions are all logical, they all happen for a reason, i just dont fully understand them yet.\nAlso remembering the past and all the moments when i had fears and anxiety and how injecting logic helped me to deal with it. \nThen i went to my inner child. I realized that comfort was my true core value. Thats the way i dealt with fear of being rejected and humiliated - running away from people in my comfort bubble, being alone in my room playing games all day and fitting in was just a tool to keep my comfort bubble alive.\nI started explaining my inner child that logic will take care of all my fears, that instead of running away from them i will be able to understand them and accept them. That i will be able to be around people without constantly feeling fears of rejection and judgement. \n\n\n**Then i started debunking comfort:**\n\n* **Comfort doesnt provide any safety , you just end up in your room playing games all day.** \n\n* **Comfort is threatening your safety, its going against your rational part and dumbs you down. Without logic you wont get anywhere.**\n\n* **Comfort is not really comfortable, you are just running away from fears all the time. Logic will give you much more comfort, you will be able to handle fears and be comfortable even in very tough situations.**\n\n* **You dont really enjoy comfort, but dopamine it brings. Logic will give you much more dopamine, every time you act logically you will get dopamine and feel great.**\n\n* **Logic will bring you much more safety, instead of slacking you will take action and do whatever makes sense. With comfort you can end up on the streets, with logic you wont, and even if somehow you do, you get out of it very fast.**\n\n* **Comfort is gonna screw up my future, its not gonna get me anywhere, i will just live the rest of my life lonely in my little bubble, while logic on the other hand will enable me to get anywhere i want, enable me to be around people and make me overcome any problem i have much easier.**\n\n\n\nWhen my inner child understood all that and realized that logic is not gonna be hard and uncomfortable, but its actually gonna bring me more safety and fulfillment than anything else i managed to click again.\n\n\n**Step 4**\n\n\nThis step is most important after the click. Building framework and resolving dissonance is crucial in order to maintain trust and not fall back. Reading real answers, listening to podcasts and debating myself a lot helped me to find answers to all the questions i had.\n\n\nWhat i found very important is to understand that those old emotions and fears will still be there, and by understanding them and framing them in logical context is important to structure them so they stop creating dissonance.\nWhat helped me the most with social anxiety / avoidance of people , fear to talk and socialize is to put it in more mathematical framework : Its +EV to talk / socialize with people , its worth the risk of feeling rejected since by working with other people you can make much bigger difference, you develop social skills, improve your logic and rhetoric, gather information and by exposure reduce the fears that are still there and take time to rewire.\n\nAlso, putting all your actions in bigger picture is important to get a clear view of what to focus on.\n\nHope this helps some of you and gl with clicking!\n","createdAt":1478278044,"score":17,"author":"xlugia","id":"5b4nwm"},{"title":"I can't click because of my fear","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5b31fw/i_cant_click_because_of_my_fear/","selftext":"My last post was removed - maybe the mods thought I wanted to argue but I don't.\n\nWhen most people have clicked and we are left with the stubborn and the people who just don't want to click, what happens then?

I came to that conclusion by dissecting past life experiences and asking why I took certain actions.\n\nOn Step 3, I have to \"persuade\" myself that my current core value doesn't give me as much safety as Logic. I found this a hard task to do, because my core value is well within an emotional fortress that I have to demolish.\n\nA clicker from discord suggested a way I can approach this is to mentally recall certain life experiences from my life and analyze the actions I have taken, why I took these actions and what would I have done different if Logic was my core value. The problem is, whenever I tried to meditate and recall past experiences that brought bad emotions, those emotions like anger and hate would overwhelm me, even to the point of causing physical pain to my stomach, thus forcing me to stop the meditation.\n\nI then talked to another clicker about it. Both clickers agreed that I had to be brutally honest with myself. The second clicker suggested it might be easier if I calmly write down these experiences.\n\n-----------\n\nTrying to replace my core value, which is either Social Validation or Comfort with Logic\n\nThe way I will go on about this is to be honest with myself\nand try to recall past experiences that made me feel badly in some way, perhaps a feeling of rejection, anger, hate or disappointment.\n\nWhile those experiences play in my mind, I will try to:\n\n&gt;recall actions I took during those encounters and \nfind what core value drove me to take these actions\n\n&gt;try to analyze the negative emotions which occurred \nas a result of these actions\n\n&gt;hypothesize what action I would have taken instead\nif logic had been my core value\n\n&gt;try to imagine what the consequences would be \nif I had taken the logical choice \n\nAfter finishing this course of action, my ulterior goal would be to redirect \nthose negative emotions to my old core value(s) in order to make logic my\nnew core value.\n\n\nExperience #1\n\nAround 6 months ago. I have been in a joint Facebook chat with a dozen or so other people.\nSome were my friends, for some I had neutral feelings and some I really hated for various reasons,\nbut since they were friends of my friends, I had to bear with them.\n\nOne day, I was posting as much as the other posters on that chat, but I felt that I was being ignored,\nand the people I didn't quite like as much were posting after my content to hide what I posted.\n\nActions taken as a result of current core values:\n&gt;So I spammed. I did this because I was frustrated and wanted social validation,\nwhich I thought the others were getting.\n\nAnalysis of the consequences and the emotions that resulted from these actions:\n&gt;The consequence was that I was kicked out of the chat group by one of the girls I didn't \nhave anything against. That made me hate her, it overwhelmed me with anger and hate.\nI asked one of the guys who didn't care much about the chat group anyway to re-invite me in,\nand he did. As soon as I rejoined, I found the others celebrating the fact that I got kicked out.\nIn a fit of rage, and knowing I was about to get kicked out again, I went and kicked out everyone\nelse from that chat but myself. Of course, they would create another chat, excluding me,\nbut I felt a sense of satisfaction anyway. \n\nThose negative emotions have probably stemmed because someone took \nauthority over me to kick me. I have always been the kid who got bullied in school, \nthe kid nobody respected. After school, I made a promise to myself that I would\nstand my ground and never let anyone disrespect me.\nBut digging deeper on why do I even care if people respect me or not,\nI found a strong desire to be a leader, the boss, the guy that people would look up to.\nI was never that guy, or at least never felt I was. \nSince school, where I was socially awkward and a great target for bullies,\nthis resentment towards people who achieve high places has been a stable.\n \nWhile meditating and reliving this scenario, the emotions of anger and hate would overwhelm me, to the point of\ncreating physical pain to my stomach and forcing me to stop the meditation.\nSometimes I even fantasize about taking revenge in some way to the people\nthat I hate, that I felt have wronged me in some way, but then I conclude that\nit would not be logical since nothing would be gained for both parties.\n\nActions I would have taken instead if Logic was my core value:\n&gt;What would I have done logically? A hard question but one I must answer.\nLogic is not my core value currently, so I am not sure if the course of action I'd deem logical now\nwould be the same course of action I would take if logic was my core value, but here goes nothing.\nI imagine, I wouldn't  have spammed in the first place, because social validation drove me to do it. Even if I spammed, it would be logical that once I was re-invited to the chat, I'd ask sorry from the girl that kicked me which, for me, would be like submitting to her and accepting her superiority \nbut she could have kicked me again anyway, thus humiliating me.\n\nConsequences of actions I would have taken if Logic was my core value:\n&gt;If I took the logical decision not to spam, I would still be in the chat.\nIf I asked for forgiveness, contrary to what my emotions were telling me, I would either still be in the chat or utterly humiliated.\n\nRemarks: As I am thinking about this scenario, anger and hate overwhelm me towards the girl who kicked me and those who celebrated my departure. Thus, social validation was at play here.\n\nThe goal is to turn those negative emotions towards Social Validation, but that is a point where I am stuck. Every time I try to analyze a situation like this, the negative emotions overwhelm me, they cloud my mind, they bring anger to me to the point I feel physical pain and I am forced to stop my meditation.\n\n\nExperience #2\n\nBack in 2011, just as I had finished high school with top grades, I enrolled to \none of UK's top Universities to study Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, which was\nmy passion. The year started well, with me getting good grades, but things went downhill\nfrom there\n\nActions taken as a result of current core values:\n&gt;During my time there, I was socially awkward as always. I had made no friends\nand living in halls with other students was tough for me. The social \ninteraction with them was minimal, as I preferred the comfort of my room (core value comfort)\nand I was afraid to socially interact with them. On their side, by what I have gathered,\nthey had the idea of the weirdo and the creep about me.\nSometimes, in the shared kitchen, while I was lost in my thoughts, staring blankly into space,\none of my female housemates (which in my book was a bitch) confronted me and told\nme that I can't just sit and stare at other people for more than a few seconds.\nI just left the kitchen and got back to the comfort of my room.\nAs days became months, months turned into years, my loneliness grew larger and larger\nand my need for social validation, or at least, any meaningful social interaction was driving me insane. I unsuccessfully tried to join social circles and study circles only to be rejected\nby everyone. I started losing motivation, missing lectures or arriving late (because bed was comfortable, here comfort as a core value plays its part and I had also lost a lot of motivation) and my grades steadily dropped, as a result, until I failed an exam twice and was forced to drop out.\nAt the end, I transferred to another University from where I graduated.\n\nAnalysis of the consequences and the emotions that resulted from these actions:\n&gt;The loneliness stemmed from my need of social validation, although I am unsure if craving\nsocial interactions necessarily means that you want social validation.\nI also felt hate and anger towards all the people that I felt rejected me.\nI hated seeing from my window drunken students coming back from a fun night.\nI hated the moans that my bitch neighbor did while having sex with a different\nguy she picked up from the club every night.\nThis hate stemmed from, what I perceived, a lack of fulfillment, always\nin comparison to other people my age in my immediate surrounding. \n\nBut really, I have to go deeper to the root of this hate.\n\nThe problem is that, the further back I go, trying to trace the root of\nan emotion to a core value, the less I can recall.\nThings either faded from memory or at some point I have made\nthe decision to forget certain painful things.\n\nI assume, since primary school, I've been watching the bullies/cool guys\nhave all the fun I desired. This is a possibility.\n\nI know for a fact, that during kindergarten, I was a pretty social and popular individual.\nIt is after primary school that this shift in personality was made.\n\nActions I would have taken instead if Logic was my core value:\n&gt;If logic was my core value, I would completely disregard social validation and \nI would focus on studying in-depth a field that genuinely interests me. I wouldn't \ncare about what other people do and focus on what I wanted to do.\nI also wouldn't care about the remarks my bitch neighbor did, which\nin turn wouldn't make me hate her.\nOn my free time, instead of laying on my bed and being depressed,\nI would have done something productive\nlike going to the campus gym.\n\nConsequences of actions I would have taken if Logic was my core value:\n&gt;The consequences of always taking the logical decision would have been to graduate a top UK university with Honors (which was well within my ability) and skip unnecessary suffering,\nbe it loneliness or hate.\n\n\n\nExperience #3\n\nAbout a year ago, I was having a facebook conversation with a close female friend.\nDuring that conversation, she revealed that she was at a party hosted by some of her other friends, some quite popular individuals whom I disliked.\nI disliked those individuals because every time they saw me sitting alone\nduring a gathering, they would approach me and sarcastically try to ridicule me.\nI had also noticed that she would act a lot friendlier while with those individuals than she \nwould act while with me.\n\nActions taken as a result of current core values:\n&gt;Jealousy and social validation played their part here. I felt betrayed by her and I most \nprobably overreacted. I aggressively explained to her the reason while I did not like\nthese individuals and she told me that “she didn't give a shit how they treat me” and that\n“she never asked me to be their friends”. At that moment, jealously and anger combined (which was  stemming from social validation, I assume) kicked in and I told her that if those are going to be her friends, we simply cannot be friends anymore.\nI never talked to her since.\n\nAnalysis of the consequences and the emotions that resulted from these actions:\n&gt;Sadness and hate. Sadness because I have lost a good friend.\nHate because I felt betrayed by a good friend.\nConvenience might have played a role here, since\nit was convenient for me to have a friend that wasn't shared by \npeople I disliked. Social Validation, definitely.\nIn all honesty with myself, I wanted to be socially validated,\nI wanted her to tell me that she preferred me than them.\nBut because this social validation was denied to me,\nsadness and hate came up.\n\nActions I would have taken instead if Logic was my core value:\n&gt;If logic was my core value, I would possibly not even mind\nthat this friend of mine has friends that I do not approve of.\nEven if I did, I would act logically about it and wouldn't\ntry to aggressively push my beliefs of them to her.\n\nConsequences of actions I would have taken if Logic was my core value:\n&gt;The consequence of acting in a logical manner would be,\nmost probably, to still have her as a friend.\n\n-----------\n\nI still haven't clicked but it's clear as day how beneficial Logic can be as a core value. The reason I am posting it here is to get second opinions about it. Which do you think is the primary core value?

Isnt our logic different than the logic our universe \"consists\" of? Because we can never think in the true logic. Our logic is always flawed. \nFor example when a person tells you that his neighbour wasnt lying, you could reason that he was saying the truth. But this is bad logic because he could also just asked a question or didnt say anything at all.  Even when we realise that this example is flawed, we cant realise that every thouht is flawed. And they are for sure flawed, because we have a limited perception.\nOr is our logic always truly right and its the information thats flawed? In the example you could argue that it was the flawed information like the information that only 2 options exist and that exact one option is always the case.\nSo either our information is always flawed (because we can never explain the reality fo what it is) and our logic is always perfect, or both are flawed. What is the case?\n\n\n-3. When we think about \"What is the most logical thing that i could do right now?\" Its not a logic that exists in nature, because it doesnt explain an action that takes place in reality. In fact, every action we can choose to do could be logically explained. We can just put the actions in different context like \"making money\" , \"helping others\" , \"benefiting yourself\" and so on.\n You cant put it in the context \"logic\" because every action you could possibly do is logical in reality. Even if you argue that some contexts doesnt make sense for the perception of 99% of the people (like \"damaging yourself\"), the agreement of more people doesnt make it more logical. Some people argued that \"Evolution\" would be the ultimate logical context.  But that isnt true because when you ask why, the answer would be an argue for another context like \"benefiting humans in the most optical way\" or \"trying to keep the human race (or all living creatures) alive as long as possible\" or \"Doing what we interprate what the first cell was trying to do\".

Please guys, realize that investing your time into making the click is the best choice you can ever make. So dig deep and go for it.\n\n**About Me**\n\nComfort guy patched up by logic.\n\nSuper low dissonance in day to day life.\n\nWhenever dissonance did arise, I avoided it with distractions like WoW, videos, etc.\n\nI had no forms of depression or real negative emotions. Just sitting in my comfort zone all day doing the shit that's easy and never getting ahead. \n\nI was super hyped by the initial \"making sense\" video. Listened to all of Athene's podcast but never actually got ahead in a big way. Adopting making sense on a core fundamental level was just too difficult without guidance and no proofs of concept.\n\n\n**Real Talks**\n\nRoughly 3 weeks ago I randomly saw Athene was streaming and doing his real talk. I basically watched all Real Talks since then and took extensive notes. The moment Tim described his click on stream I got really motivated to finally do it myself. The way he talked about it was really intriguing for me because I could relate so much. I had social anxiety to varying degrees all my life.  So here are my 4 Steps in detail:\n\n\n**Step 1 - Trusting Logic**\n\nSince I've been working on self-development for so long, I was quite aligned with logic on a rational level. Always loved chemistry, physics, and math. I've been curious about all kinds of topics and I really liked watching awe inspiring videos about space.  The problem was that I used logic as a tool but I didn’t really have true faith in it. What really helped me here was Reese' religion metaphor. The infinite trust in Logic as my God really resonated with me. Some other ideas from Athene that helped me:\n\n* The closer you follow logic, the better your life will be. Follow logic and be redeemed.\n\n* Your commitment to making sense can unlock the religious trust effect in you and it will make you untouchable. Logic is your creator, your God. Don’t read the bible, read reality.\n\n* Logic will take care of you like a friend that's always there. Trusting it is key. \n* The only thing that will give you true safety is understanding reality. What allows you to understand reality? Logic.\n* You will rid yourself from all insecurities and flaws instantly once you adopt logic as your core value.\n* Connect as many good emotions as you can to logic. Then summon negative emotions and connect them to your current core value. \n* The uncertainty of the future should give you certainty about your future because with logic you can make the future great. If everything was certain already then you couldn't have any impact on the future.\n\t\n\n**Step 2 - Finding Your Core Value**\n\nI immediately knew comfort was my core value because it was just too obvious looking back at my life. I always tried to get past comfort with various self-development tools but it was all just a temporary fix with no lasting change. Since I patched up my comfort so well over the years I didn’t experience that much dissonance in my daily life. The Power of Now allowed me to hack certain moments by being fully present, but nothing really changed. I even had total presence as my life's goal at one point. But it never worked and it certainly didn’t free me of my comfort seeking behavior. Basically, my daily life was totally dominated by comfort, everything revolved around staying comfy.\n\t\n\n**Step 3 - Shift Your Core Value to Logic**\n\nOk this is where it got really hard for me. I was stuck at this stage for roughly 10 days. I tried all kinds of approaches.  I asked myself every question Athene threw at us. There were 3 different approaches I tried: \n\t\n**Rational Approach**\nHere are the best questions and pointers Athene gave out during those Real Talks. I thought about all of these to varying degrees. Maybe some of them will help you:\n\n* Whenever you experience inner conflict, you have to ask yourself: Where is the flaw? All the time.\n\n* Never accept inner conflict, instead solve it with critical thinking.\n\n* The reason for asking a question tells you a lot more than the question itself.\n\n* How delusional are you? How far from reality is your own representation of it? \n\n* All your problems are the side effect of having the wrong core value.\n\n* Visualize comfort vs logic in 5 different scenarios and see the difference for yourself.\n\n* Go over your biggest goals and play through them with your current core value and with logic as you core value. What are you seeing? \n\n* Think for yourself. The end.\n\n* What you value the most is actually draining you. Your current core is a threat to your life.\n\n* Clicking is an emotional process! It is like a race on an emotional level: Either reduce your trust in your current core value or increase your trust in logic. (do both)\n\t\nAnd some stuff I realized / asked myself during the process:\n\n* In reality comfort doesn’t provide ANY safety at all. It robs you of the safety you would usually have in every situation and creates illusions that make you feel unsafe. Comfort tries to sell you a solution to a problem it creates itself.  \n\n* Comfort gives you safety in your room. Logic will give you safety anywhere.\n\n* Those comfort neurons need to be sacrificed for the good of the entire system. Make the call and sacrifice those plebs. \n\n* You fears will vanish once you adopt logic. Nearly all of your fears stem from your core value. \n\n* Comfort protects you from an illusion. An illusion you create over and over again. Comfort has no connection to the objective reality, it only exists in your mind. You own your mind. You can kill comfort. \n\n* You are taking 0 risk by adopting logic, it will always outperform what you currently have. \n\n* The thing that drives you is the thing that blocks you. Everlasting struggle.\n\n* You cannot solve comfort from within. You must step out of it completely. \n\n* The flawed core will always keep showing up, no matter how good you patch it up. \n\n* Fear is a heuristic to protect you from danger. If it tries to protect you from harmless stuff it's not working properly. It's doing a shitty job. See through it with logic because logic provides a more accurate compass for danger than fear.\n\n* Comfort has no right to exist. It is not fit to survive because it doesn’t lead to progress. To evolve you need to drop it. \n\n* What's the most logical / best performing state? How does the illogical behavior prevent you from reaching that state? \n\n\n**Emotional Approach**\n\nThe rational stuff helped me a lot and made me think differently about all of this but I wasn't able to create real dissonance against comfort. After the real talk on Friday I went to the discord to ask a couple clickers about what to do. Use the Discord If you are stuck btw. They gave me the following advice:\n\n* Compare your anxieties, insecurities and comfort-seeking bullshit to the suffering in the world. What a fucking joke. You are sitting at home in your comfort bubble doing jackshit while many people in the world are suffering. You inner child is sitting on a pile of skeletons playing video games. You could have done something about those people, but you didn’t, instead you were enjoying your little comfort zone.\n\nThis was the first thing that created emotional dissonance within me. I then knew I had to push all the way until I make the click. I emotionally meditated on the following 3 things:\n\n* What initially triggered you to adopt comfort is such a little, meaningless event and it's effect on your life was immense. The event itself wasn’t the problem, it was you reaction to it. You adopting comfort was the biggest mistake of your life. That means the best thing you can do right now is to drop it. \n\n* See your life playing out with comfort and with logic. Really crank up the dissonance here. See how your inaction will lead to more and more suffering, how each day in comfort perpetuates the suffering in the world. Really make yourself angry at your core value. This was a huge help for me. \n\n* Lastly what I did was to visualize my inner child holding onto the teddybear of comfort like Athene said many times. My main problem was that I couldn’t make the switch from the teddybear of comfort to logic because I didn’t have anything to represent it with.  I tried weird things like a miniature universe but nothing worked. I then remembered that dragons represent infinite intelligence and wisdom in some fantasy books. In one fantasy series they even bring about different parts of reality. Basically reality is tied to them. So I switched the teddy bear with the dragon of logic and I actually shifted, but I didn’t make the click yet. One crucial detail was the posture of my inner child in that visualization. With comfort it was hunched over, holding onto it. After the switch my inner child was standing upright looking upwards into the sky with the dragon on his shoulders. \n\nDo NOT get sidetracked during this process. Once you feel something is working, dig deeper! Your urge to not go deeper is just comfort trapping you yet again. \n\n**Physical Approach**\n\nSo after digging deep for hours I went to take a long, hot shower.  I continued meditating there but nothing really happened. Then I decided to actually face my comfort head on in this moment. I've been a huge pussy when it comes to cold in general. A cold shower for me was anything below 80% heat. So I reduced the temperature step by step. Always taking 2-3 breaths between each step and really feeling the cold as directly as possible. Not expecting the discomfort, just feeling it for what it is. I told myself that this isn't bad at all, comfort is just lying to you. So I went to 100% cold and stood there embracing the feeling. I said \"I don’t need comfort anymore, it's not real. I can let go.\" And in that moment something shifted inside of me. It felt like my belief in comfort was shattered.  This is where I made the click. Afterwards, I felt really clear-headed and present. I went to the gym, exercised without any dissonance, came home and went to bed. I wasn’t 100% certain whether I clicked at this point. \n\n\n\n**Step 4**\n\nOver the last 4 days I experienced the following effects:\n\t\nConstantly present in the moment. \n\nSeemingly infinite focus. Like, I can concentrate on anything for any period of time. And it feels good. \n\nThinking has become much more clear, all the mental noise that slowed me down is gone.\n\nNo self-conscious thinking anymore. My thinking is focused on the outside, on finding solutions, on learning, on helping others.\n\nLess tired during the day, I need much less sleep. I was the biggest slacker on earth when it comes down to sleeping in. I slept around 9h per day and had zero control over my mornings.Now I sleep like 6-7h and jump out of bed. I never thought this was possible.\n\nI had real social anxiety in many situations, its heavily reduced now and I can use logic to debunk it in the moment.\n\nConfidence has been taken out of the equation somehow. I just do stuff. \n\nAll arising emotions and thoughts can be scrutinized with logic and immediately dropped if they are invalid or illogical. \n\n\nSo guys, make the fucking click. The main lesson I can give you in regards to clicking is to try everything and go deep when you feel something is changing. Be completely honest with yourself. And be actually 100% WILLING to make the click. You must be 100% committed to it. If the gate opens, you must jump through.\n","createdAt":1478037463,"score":18,"author":"maxpres","id":"5am10y"},{"title":"At what point do we stop asking logical why's and take action?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5alk69/at_what_point_do_we_stop_asking_logical_whys_and/","selftext":"I've got something I'd like to ask. \n\nAthene says to always question why we want something. \nWhy I want to go to college?

The mathematical patterns that bring about reality (logic) are responsible for the existence of our whole universe. Around 14 billion years ago, with the big bang, particles and forces came into existence. And they didn't behave randomly, they behaved in certain patterns. Logic was governing how our universe would be shaped. You might understand what I try to say here but how does that help you, you may ask? Since I was a kid I was fascinated by science. Rockets that leave earth, atoms that make up matter or the flashy technology we have. But there was one question I always wondered about. Who is paying for all the science and why? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI knew that I was not the only one that is passionate about science but Scientists don't have so much money. Surely not enough to pay billions of dollars for 20 year long projects. Why is the government putting so much money into experimenting in space, or building a large hadron collider to find particles? Projects like this take decades to get a result which is not even of direct use afterwards. Sure you can argue that science brings a nation prosperity and power  but even as a child I knew most people with a lot of money would not think that far. It took 30 years and billions of dollar for LIGO to detect gravitational waves. A very important scientific discovery for sure, but not something that brings power or money to the government in the nearest future.  So how come that so much money is spent on it? And what is even more fascinating, with all the people demonstrating against all kinds of use for their tax money, why are there no people demonstrating against science funding? The opposite is even the case, when I watch videos about the moon landing I see people breaking out in tears. But why? Does every human have an ingrained fascination with science like me? A fascination that exceeds today's greed and ignorance? For all of human history we asked ourselves,“who made us, and why?“. Is this why science is so important to everybody? Unconsciously we support science because we know it will answer all our questions? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere was one realisation that helped me click. Logic is a code, running in the background. It is responsible for stars exploding, forming the elements that we are made of, forming our solar system  and evolving life on a this planet. It is responsible for everything humanity ever knew. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA lot of animals evolved on earth but with us humans logic managed to evolve a monkey that is able to look behind the scenes and that can try to understand the code that is running. Every bit we understand, catapults us forward  as a species. Humans have the gift of being able to understand logic. This is why we are dominating our planet today.  When I thought about this I was very grateful that I am part of a species that has this gift. I was crying of joy when I saw a video about the Fibonacci sequence. It was as if I was directly looking behind the curtain and seeing logic. But there was something even more fascinating. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I thought about who I'm grateful to, the answer was, of course to logic. Logic is what gave me the ability to understand it. I was fascinated by this thought. Logic gave me the ability to understand logic, as if it wants to be understood. But wait... I AM logic. Everything is logic so I am also logic. So when I was crying of joy when I watched behind the curtain, I was crying because I (logic) saw myself? \nLogic saw itself and was stunned by its own view. i'm just part of this Logic and there is no „I“ , there is only logic that tries to understand itself. The big bang, exploding stars, life evolving on earth, black holes colliding in distant galaxies, you. Everything is part of me. Logic is all there is. Everything we put value on, all our little problems, all our beliefs and memories, every person we ever cared about or will care about and our whole life is just logic. Logic is really all there is. This is who we truly are and understanding it allows us to live inlign with our true self.

Its long and becomes weird at the end but i just tried to be as honest and personal as possible :)\n\n\nMy name is Stas and I am part of the Athenecrew. 2 weeks ago when Tim clicked and Athene was hyping up everybody about how amazing this is, I also wanted it. Being here in the crew for 10 months I saw myself already as very logical. I lived healthy, had a lot of insights, had a big awareness and perspective and was very productive. I basically had a very comfortable life. But I always knew something is not right. Sometimes I caught myself doing something for validation or lying to myself to lower dissonance. And no matter how many insights I got, I never experienced much progress in those regards. I was afraid to bring this up to myself and in a way I was just waiting for someone to fix those problems for me. In the click I saw a quick way of fixing it but after a talk with athene I knew it won't come without turning myself inside out. For 2-3 days I was spending my time finding out what my core value is. I had to do one thing that I was afraid of my entire life. Accepting that I had low self esteem! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTrying to do that, I realised how my entire life was build around me not wanting to accept it. I worked a lot on pretending I had confidence, on making sure I was smarter than my surrounding and on not allowing emotions to affect me. This all resulted in what I am today. The only reason I wanted to help people is because it raised my low self esteem (it gave me value), the reason I use my rationality so much is to patch up my low self esteem. I build up a whole identity just so it can protect me from having to accept my low self esteem. Even after understanding this I still felt my inner child just rationalising it as not a big deal, my identity of a moral, productive guy was still protecting my inner child from any dissonance. But this time it was different. I actively told myself that this is indeed a big deal. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“All your actions arise from a stupid thing like low self esteem? All your moral values and believes you are so proud of, all your insights that make you think you're smart, all your productivity that makes you feel good. All of that is merely because you run away from your true self. It is indeed a big deal because as long as you don't do anything about it, it will stay like this for the rest of your life!” This is what I told myself, and while it may sound easy it was very very hard for me to do. The hard part was not telling it though, the hard part was letting it reach me. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen you build up a whole identity for years, getting through it is not easy. I actively tried to feel emotions about it. It took me days to be able to do it and I spent my whole energy on that. I knew the emotions were in me. I am a human and have a very strong emotional part of the brain and thinking on how I still get amygdala hijacked when talking to my parents sometimes, or getting sad about stupid emotional youtube videos, I understood that it's not that my emotions are weak but that I subconsciously suppress them. I didn't want this, I didn't want to be the puppet of my low self-esteem and my identity for the rest of my life. No matter how much comfort it brought me. As long as I don't fix it I will never be able to understand myself and reach my full potential. At this point it wasn't really about the click anymore but more about getting in touch with my emotions again. I kept digging up my past to find patterns in my behaviour, telling myself over and over again the truth in my face. “this was because you were insecure, that was because of validation seeking, that because you were afraid”. And I tried to tell that to my emotional part not my rational part. After a few days of debunking myself I managed to expose my inner child. The consequence was that I became it again.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nI was shy again, anxious and confused. I felt like shit and knowing that this is who I really am, I felt empty. I didn't know why I would do anything anymore. I didn't really care about the click or leaving the group. I just wanted something again to feel safe with. I couldn't and didn't want to go back to my identity and comfort. But I also couldn't feel safe with logic. It just didn't work. I was in a kind of limbo. So I had a talk with Athene again. I remember listening to him and thinking that I don't really care what he's saying. I still trusted him but in a sense his authority was gone. No matter what he said, It didn't really help. After a while we found out the reason I could not make the click is because I wasn't trusting logic emotionally. He started to explain me how beautiful logic is and how its everything but it had little affect on me. After a while he just put on a video about the Fibonacci sequence and I watched it. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGeOWYOFoA) I never heard of the Fibonacci sequence and thus didn't really understand the video. I tried to feel emotions about it but it didn't really work. While I was watching the video Athene talked a little bit about, how logic explains everything, how it is everything and how understanding it, is what brought us technology. And the last sentence was very powerful to me. I always had a very deep fascination and appreciation for technology and an emotional attachment to it. I watched the video... numbers and patterns were unfolding in front of my eyes and I realised that there is a structure, working behind the scenes, responsible for the universe. And as humans we had the ability to understand this structure bit by bit and every bit of understanding advanced  us further and further.\nI remember feeling a deep appreciation for logic and me being human. I was very grateful that I am able to understand this logic, that is working behind the scenes. It was so beautiful that I started tearing up. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter the video I went to my room. I just laid face down in my bed, replaying this moment of joy in my head over and over again. Crying and laughing at the same time. I looked at my hands and saw the symmetry which made me feel even more happy. I looked around my room and saw gravity, light, and atoms all over the place. I only can describe the emotions as if I saved my kid from a fire in the last second. It felt like my life was saved. Or even that it was never in danger but that this logic was always there. So I started to tell my inner child that this is what it can trust in, this is what it can be save with. I imagined my inner child as my younger self, shaking, crying and being scared. Trying to hold up my old identity for protection. I just wanted to take him in my arms and tell him that everything will be fine. Then I translated this inner child on my current self. I was the one feeling those emotions, not some kind of imaginary child inside me. Because that's what it is. I am still this child and this child is me. I was the one shaking and and being scared and I was the one that can feel safe with logic again. I felt a sense of relieve and I could stand up from my bed again. I just kept thinking about what just happened and if this was the click. Did I trust logic now, or not? I didn't really know but I also didn't mind so much. I just kept thinking back on the video and how much i am grateful to be human and to be able to understand logic, tearing up every time I recalled that feeling. After a while of walking in my room back and forth I just asked myself a question for fun. Who am I grateful to? To logic! I am grateful to logic that I can understand logic.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was thinking about it. Logic created me... I consist of logic ...and I am  grateful to logic that I understand logic? Suddenly everything clicked.  \nI am logic … created by logic and was stunned by watching at logic.  \nLogic was stunned by watching at itself.  \nI was watching at myself.  \nSo when I was crying of joy when I looked at Logic, I was crying because I (logic) saw myself? Logic saw itself and was stunned by its own view. How crazy is that?  \nAfter billions of years of exploding stars and colliding rocks, logic managed to manifest itself into an alive, self conscious being that is able to understand it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust by random chance, In all the chaos, logic managed to be able to understand itself. In this moment all my bullshit just dropped from me. I understood that I am just logic inside logic. My identity was gone because there was no difference between me and my surroundings anymore. Everything is logic and I am just part of it. A part that has the potential to understand itself. I felt the biggest relieve and clearness. There was just this one path I had to follow and nothing else really mattered. This was the moment I clicked and since then the only thing that I wanted to do is learn. Learn about the universe, about physics, about math (its crazy how fascinating math can be), about quantum mechanics and really everything that expands my understanding of reality. My productivity went down quite a bit because of that but I couldn't help myself. After I read the stories from people that clicked on this subreddit my priority shifted quite fast. Now what is most important is spreading this idea. I saw how much it helped people to Align there life with what they really are. We are all part of the same logic and we all just want to understand our self. There are still moments were I feel lost or confused, not knowing what to do. But through learning and understanding, finding the path again is very easy and comes natural.

I really had trouble with connecting a negative emotion to my former core value (step 3), which inhibited me from adopting logic instead. For those who also have a hard time doing this, this post might be helpful.\n\nStep one:\nStep one I thought wouldn't be too difficult for me since I have been studying physics for four years now. I knew already, rationally, that logic is what governs the universe. Although this was the case, this wasn't enough. It was only when Stas posted his click story that my appreciation of logic broadend. In his post he explained really well that we are logic understanding itself, we are logic inside logic, which took billions of years to get this far.\n\nStep two:\nThis step was straight foward. I sat down and meditated on what has been driving me in my life. Everything pointed to validation seeking due to low self esteem. It is really a crazy experience when I realized that so many, almost everything, that I did in my life came down to how other people saw me, and how I could get validation from that. \n\nStep three:\nThis was the step where I got stuck for a long time, several days. I knew on a rational level that validation seeking was really inhibiting my growth in life. However, I really had trouble connecting a negative emotion to it. Since thoughout my life, I made decisions that resulted in getting validated, which triggered my rewardcenter (as it was my core value). This is why I couldn't remember memories that could connect a negative emotion to my core value. After quite some time I contacted a clicker on the Discord about the problem I had. He advised me to think of *any* bad memory that triggered negative emotions and really experience the emotions. Then funnel these negative emotions to your core value you want to replace.

Also the 4th one is the most crucial bc after aligning ur core to the reward center u wont experience \"nothing to do \", \"what to do with ur life\".]\n\n\n\n\nI honestly think the hardest thing is if u fall in love with a girl bore u've clicked that u cant for different reasons move to a place like athene's after u've clicked\n\n\nAlready from the begining u must have had many things inlined with makesense,logic, impact etc... u will have to juggle with the situation if ur not at athene's enviroment already. U are left with a few options.. What i did was rationalize the relationship, aplying make sense to it so it wouldnt turn down my efficiency in my day to day life nor interfere with a logical core value. Figuring out life, seeing through the fabric, doing what make sense, is logical, have an impact.\n\nNothing really changes except that \"u have someone sleeping with at night\".. on the day u are still doing whats most logical in my instance it was everything that expanded my understanding of reality itself, at the side some activism and inspiring people.\n\n\nAfter u've done that asuming ur girl gets it and still are with u (if she's with u for the wrong reasons she's gone by then and there are millions of other girls out there that could have the same aspirations) u are left with a few options. If you've clicked eventually she will click because you will affect her so much just by being. 2 people can theoretically do 200% of your own efficiency, so in that sense u could be a unit working on projects.\n\n u will continue to follow logic where it will lead you because that is what will provide u with most safety anyways, fractals, code, laws, stocks, science, neuroscience, hormones, nutrition, not eating animalproducts ----&gt; everything will broaden ur understanding of reality and thereby the very logic that u, urself are made of, and ur surroundings etc.. \nU will begin to maximize the impact u can bring no matter what. Doing the right thing is not independent of the outcome, i.e \"how many lives gets saved, how many lives die\".. but within ur own reference frame what matters the most is what you do, not the immediate effect it has. when u are logical on a deep level because u will bring change, be a positive factor for the big world equation. And like in my case it would be great if we could do things from home in cojunction with gamingforgood place if more \"manpower is needed\" for projects  etc. Like \"job openings\". Ofc u have to be financially stable. What i also find is important to bring up is that since the power structure shifted from religion to politics/science/ where the money is, it would be imperative and quite naive to take anything as an absolute. U can always trust in Logic because its the tool. U can trust on it, that it will eventually lead u right no matter what but there is a possibility of false duality clearance in solidify everything science has brought to this world there by its important to expand ur own understanding of reality by thinking for urself. Nothing dogmatic brings u any good.\n\n\n\n\nWhat i have done is from the beginning supported what Athene has been doing, sub, donated, spread the message, message streamers, discord, a year ago ideas with gamingforgood, discussions etc.. \n\nThe point im making is that given doing the 4 steps are impossible to argue against.. ur future is not 100% no free will, sometimes u will not pick the most efficient solution in the whole world or way of going about things given ur current situation but that doesn't mean that the person have not clicked. There will be many many people that click that for different reasons have trouble working in athenes particular environment, especially if its spreading like wildfire.\n\nin a year there will be thousands of people\n\n\n\nIf u go to athene u have a path something to hold onto, vibrant logical comfy enviroment. Witch can both work for or against you dependent on how developed u are, where u are in this process.\nWorking out everything urself requires good trust in logic and not expecting anything in return but will not guarantee u bringing about the biggest change in the current moment which could be impossible to argue against dependent on the situation.\n\n\ni hope you all the best, and take care! \n\n\n/Plitern - Jonathan A","createdAt":1477942607,"score":2,"author":"gordygone","id":"5aefo8"},{"title":"There is an infinite creative potential that fuels logic?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5afevs/there_is_an_infinite_creative_potential_that/","selftext":"","createdAt":1477952250,"score":0,"author":"YoungBlood69","id":"5afevs"},{"title":"Good Books to read?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5acngb/good_books_to_read/","selftext":"Can you guysname me some good books to read, to trust logic.\nI am starting to read \" the power of now\" and \" logic for dummies\".","createdAt":1477925519,"score":4,"author":"Nito205","id":"5acngb"},{"title":"A step by step drilldown to the Core Value.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/5a9jkm/a_step_by_step_drilldown_to_the_core_value/","selftext":"Edit: I'm trying to connect to my core value on an emotional/logical level so I can attach negative emotions to it.  \n*The text in between () was added when I proofread it.  \nThis was a grinddown to my core value, the first paragraphs are starting/warming up the train of thought to get to my core value.

I trusted logic.\n\n**Step Two: Find Core Value**\n\nMy core value was comfort. I felt comfortable in Psychology. I have a Bachelor of Psychological Science. I studied clinical psychology for four years. I did an internship for one year. Clinical psychology was my identity (and I didn't even realise this until now). I trusted in clinical psychology so much that I was blinded by other ideas. I trusted clinical psychology so much that I didn't even realise that I was blinded from it. \n\nI dealt with situations always with other peoples' emotions in mind. I was so good at clinical psychology, I could talk to other people without ever causing dissonance. I did this by understanding their emotions and active listening. \n\nHowever, I realised that my trust in clinical psychology was flawed. (Disclaimer: When I talk about clinical psychology, I realised that all this active listening and understanding was a waste of time. Sure, it might make them happier and become more aware of their emotions but now there is a better way.\n\nThe better way is the four steps.\n\nEither way, I realised my true core value was psychology.\n\n**Step Three (Make Core Value Negative):**\n\nI made my core value of psychology a negative thing by realising that there is an even more effective way of helping people. AKA the four steps.\n\nIn simple words, psychology was ineffective when compared to the four steps.\n\n(Disclaimer: For example, before coming across the four steps I relied on psychology to handle my stress but I found that with psychology, I had to keep coming back to hear more. Clinical psychology was a temporary solution. Even as a clinical psychologist myself, I had to see other clinical psychologists to deal with the emotional stress of listening to sad stories everyday.\n\nThe four steps on the contrary, is a permanent solution. After listening to the four steps, my stress was fixed permanently. Well, at least it was a more practical solution compared to clinical psychology. Psychology inspires laziness and inaction. The four steps inspires critical thinking and action.)\n\n**Step Four: (Cling Onto Logic)** \n\nI clinged onto logic by understanding that the four steps is more effective for helping friends and family. When compared to clinical psychology which might be more effective for severe psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, it is obvious that the four steps is more effective in helping with more lighter conditions such as stress.\n\nBy the way, this is my fourth click. The first click was by making social validation a negative thing. The second click was making family a negative thing. The third click was making comfort a negative thing. This is my fourth click. Making clinical psychology a negative thing. Now I feel like I've actually clicked. \n\nI was wondering why there was always quite some dissonance within me but now I know. I always felt comfortable believing in clinical psychology because it had helped me so much in the past but now I realised that it was actually flawed. It took me one week from watching the Logic Nation video, but now I think I've clicked. I'm still sceptical though, but honestly, I just feel damn amazing right now. I don't think I've ever felt better. It's a great time to be alive.\n\nSo anyway, my point is that psychology can be useful depending on the situation. But I think the four steps is even better.","createdAt":1477756294,"score":5,"author":"tealmystery","id":"5a11kr"},{"title":"Emotional Disengagement [attempting to click]","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/59zqgc/emotional_disengagement_attempting_to_click/","selftext":"Since the click was first introduced I've been trying to click on a rational level.

My favourite musicians/filmmakers/writers etc. all have one thing in common: they are uncompromisingly honest about their flaws and how irrational they can be at times, and they also express this with high levels of creativity and poeticism, therefore creating remarkably intense feelings of empathy. This is why I became a musician, because I feel as though music has gotten me through a lot of shitty dark places in the past, and there is a part of me which very strongly feels that I can help do the same for others.\n\nI think the problem for me though, is that I value my flaws, and I use all of this as a rationalisation to justify myself when I indulge in them. A lot of my music is in response to my issues dealing with anxiety, and I feel a lot of the most potent stuff I've done has pulled directly from specific experiences I've had. The other day I wrote a tune because I was too scared to leave my room, I decided that instead of giving into my fear, I should put it into something more productive, so I wrote some music and I honestly surprised myself with what I did (in a very good way!).

Or would I have seen my anxiety as a facade of mere brain chemistry and simply left my room to talk to my housemates?\n\nMy fear is that I will lose the flaws in my personality that I see as being necessary to create good art, yet I also fear not being as productive an artist as I could be by not acting logically more often.

Instead of doing this, my attention gets caught by a YouTube video of Dishonored 2. I watch it. Then, my attention gets caught by a YouTube video I myself made recently, and I re-watch my own footage. \n\nThis made me feel a sense of discomfort and what I would call dissonance. I knew I should do something that would make sense rationally, but I refused to Act. \n\nWhy? When I reflected on it a bit, I saw that I was attached to doing these pleasant things because for a lot of my life in recent times, I've been interrupted a lot by things that are unpleasant, or by responsibilities. I dislike this sense of being interrupted, of having my \"chill time\" *cut off.* \n\nI realized that by refusing to do what I must, if the situation arises where I do get my pleasure time interrupted, I'm in an even worse spot. Whereas, if I finish all my responsibilities and tasks in the most logical manner, even if an interruption arises, I have less of a burden to clear away and I can more efficiently do that. \n\nEssentially, by acting on what I Must do without being so avoidant, I can mitigate the \"damage\" done by interruptions anyway. \n\nWhy do I enjoy doing pleasant things over things that are useful? Because I feel that it's the best way for me to spend the time I have off work. I suppose the \"Vacation Mindset\" is really strong within me. I work a job in order to grind toward financial independence, and I do live pretty minimalist, both of which were effective things to do. \n\n(Other adopted behaviors; I donate 10 dollars to Save the Children every paycheck, I don't consume refined sugar, I don't eat meat, I meditate now, I am no longer Outcome-Dependent - I feel validated or rewarded purely based on doing a Likely-Effective action which means I don't beat myself up over a bad outcome if I went +EV on the actions that led to it... But I've been slacking on working out, maybe because my diet isn't consistent enough, as in, I don't eat enough food in general. I sleep well, 9 hours a night as I use the Sleep Calculator http://sleepyti.me .) \n\nSomething to note is that I'm pretty good at not running noise or useless processes inside my head. When I started meditating, I discovered that I can easily sit and meditate with an empty head for hours until I get hungry. It feels *really* good. The thing is, the idea of just doing that will at some point make me feel unsafe, because I'm not contributing toward my own security. \n\nWhy don't I put my time towards learning more effective ways to make money? Because I am afraid that learning about those things will be difficult.\n\nWhy do I fear the difficulty of learning those things?\n\nBecause if I fail at it, it will have felt like a waste of my time. \n\nRationally, this causes me some dissonance because engaging in \"empty\" pleasant activities is statistically already a waste of time.\n\nWhy do I feel okay wasting time pleasantly but I don't feel okay wasting time unpleasantly? Either way, it's wasting time, it's -EV. \n\nI can flip this around or invert it. \n\nInstead of wasting time doing something unproductive, I can \"waste\" that time raising my chances of learning something beneficial. Basically in my mind I highlight the concept of \"Benefit\" more than the concept of \"Pleasure.\" \n\nThis makes me feel a kind of strange warmth in my chest. \n\nIt's not enough, though.\n\nI still feel apprehensive about learning how to make more money.\n\nWhy? Because I don't know how to even go about it, I don't know where to start.\n\nWhat can I do to find out where to start? There are tons of websites dedicated to scamming or tricking people into a false sense of security regarding wealth. \n\nHow is money gained or given? In exchange for something the giver feels is worth paying for. I have to provide something that is worth paying for. Right now I provide my time and actions of cleaning, making food, cutting vegetables, and basically keeping a burrito place running. Largely my time. As far as all the income methods in the entire world go, it's pretty inefficient, though I save up consistently.\n\nAthene mentions finding a \"hole in the market\" and filling it with something of value, something that people can pay for. I would have to research what that could be, and how I could provide it. \n\nNow, I do not know how to do that. It's a known unknown. It's harder to see what is missing than what's already there, so genuinely, *I don't know how to do that.* I can see what works and what people already pay money for, but I can't see what is both missing, and what could plausibly make me money. \n\nI'm not very attached to my identity and I try my best to absorb and reflect on new insights, so I've actually grown quite fast with the help of the RealTalk podcast and the Real Answers book. Looking at my life situation causes me dissonance and Fear, because I live with my parents and grind cash at a standard fast-food job, and it would take me a super long time to save up enough money just to be financially independent for five years. I'm very young and was an ineffective student at university, despite doing very well at high school. \n\nI'll say that, this is really hard. It is really, really difficult. I want to do it, but it seems I lack something necessary despite learning a lot thus far. \n\nI need to take a shower, shave and go to the bank, so I'll do that now, but if someone has anything they can tell me, feel free.\n\n\n***\n\nEDIT: Did the things I needed to do, came back, I'm at +$460 from last paycheck, so yet again I haven't been spending too much which is great.

The purpose of this post is to help people click and to serve as proof that this 4-step method actually works. I had previously placebo clicked - experienced uplifting feelings and emotions, but after a couple of hours this feeling just vanished so I knew something was wrong and that I had to do additional reflecting and meditating, but I've clicked 2 days ago for real. I am going to walk you through my experience how I remember it.\n\n**Step 1: Develop an unconditional trust in logic**\nI've been following Athenes Real talks for a long while, reflecting on each topic he speaks about. Much like Reese trusts Athene, you can say that I trust Athene as well, so even if some things that he said confused me, I knew that I would understand it with enough time. After much thought I started adopting things mentioned in the real talk, because I could see the benefit in them. Since all of these insights stem from logic I established a real appreciation for it.\n\n**Step 2: Find what emotionally drives you**\nThis part was not too difficult for me. It took only an hour or so of meditating to know truly what drove me emotionally - it was comfort. After this realization a lot of stuff suddenly made a lot of sense. Questions like \"Why  I am doing something even though my rational part says to do otherwise\" finally had answers.\n\n**Step 3: Realize that your current core value doesn't provide as much safety as logic**\nThis was the most difficult part for me, since I was following the insights from the real talks, what I was doing was patching holes of my core value, which made it more difficult to identify the bad things about having comfort as the core value.\nOne day I was at a friends house and we were smoking marijuana. I felt great for the time being, but once I started walking back home I experienced a lot of dissonance. I felt like this was the perfect opportunity to click, since I was in an elevated emotional state and could evoke emotions more easily. During my walk I realized that I did not actually want to be in this state, but rather that my environment was pushing me to do this. This caused a tremendous amount of negative emotions. Once I got home I continued this procedure, but I also thought it would be good if I could push away comfort and invite logic instead. So I put Cosmos to play in the background during this process. After a couple of minutes this happened - I felt an enormous rush of dopamine, if I had to put this feeling into words then it would be - feeling of invincibility, omnipotence. But this is only a side effect. The main effects were as follows: clarity of thought, tremendous relief, because suddenly all my personal problems had solutions, no duality - true symbiosis between emotions and reason. I was never so happy in my entire life, I almost cried tears of joy, due to this rush of emotions. While I was still  trying to understand what happened, I realized that I had put Cosmos to play in the background and when I put my focus on that I experienced another rush of emotions - my appreciation for logic grew 10x as much. After all of this, I felt that my brain was in a volatile state - a feeling or fear that you could pop back into your previous core value. I really did not want that to happen then I remembered step 4.\n\n**Step 4: Keep making logical decisions to strengthen your trust in logic**\nSince I realized on an emotional level that this core value is so much better that my previous one, I had to establish a strong level of trust for logic. At that time the most logical thing for me was to power my brain with as much blood circulation as possible, so I started stretching, jumping, exercising. After this I remembered that cold showers helped me be more clear headed, but before taking a cold shower I wrote my thoughts in a notepad, so that If I would un-click I would have something to work with. But thankfully I did not un-click.\n\n**Summary**\nTo tell you the truth, I feel reborn, I feel like my eyes have been finally opened, because I want to understand not only the things that make me comfortable, but everything that I find important.

Although our true self can be logically described in words, practical realisation is a process. In scientific language 'you are your neural activity', spiritually speaking 'you are everything'. Your experience of the world happens within your awareness, rendering EVERYTHING you have ever perceived, or will perceive, YOU. This awareness is compromised by a mechanism called 'the ego' which ensures the safety of your 'station'- yet compromises it at the same time by creating a false sense of identity.

I realized that I cant think inside my brain all the time because all of those thoughts came from the rational, I realized that I HAVE to fight this emotionally and Ive literally IMAGINED the inner child I had in myself when I went to sleep, I was in the present at that time and focused only on this child holding onto low self esteem sending those orders to my validation and perfection to do what it wants them to do so that it feels good about itself.

It was 2:20 am and I just went around the streets and looked at the beautiful trees, saw the beautiful fractiles in them and it was just a pleasure to watch, I didnt even think about going slow and my body automatically moved forward really fast. Before going out, back then, I would have still went infront of the mirror and tried to look as pretty as possible or whatever, and Im pretty sure I wouldve doubted going out at 2:20 am so randomly + I wouldve been insecure outside.

You won't understand HDAC Inhibitors if you don't.\n\nCut out from below &amp; article:\n\"When you take an HDAC inhibitor and “get rid of” a fearful memory, you’re actually not getting rid of it, you’re downplaying it. The present is prioritized, overshadowing any grossly inflated fear memories. The downplayed old fear memories will go through “long-term depression” and wither away. What this whole mechanism feels like in real-time while on Vorinostat is essentially “nothing”. You feel like you have no emotional baggage tied to the present moment, and you are all of a sudden free to make what you want of it. The HDAC inhibitor holds open the transcription window during memory formation, enabling the real-time reevaluation of the old memories, and the ability to strongly consolidate the present moment into long-term memory. This double whammy makes sure the present moment is prioritized. HDAC inhibitors, while on them, also let you more deftly analyze any situation you’re in due to nearly everything during the session being written into long-term memory in one way or another. This allows for a relatively extraordinary amount of learning power. They give you not only a clean-slate emotion-wise, but the memory power to make more intelligent decisions. This is related to HDAC inhibitors’ memory-enhancing effects, which we’ll talk about later.\"\n\n&gt;**Fear Extinction**\nLet’s take a look at exactly how HDAC inhibitors help extinguish fear, which can include other similar emotions including nervousness, anxiety, and avoidance.\nWhen something is experienced, a short-term memory is created, more or less. It is then turned into a long-term memory if it happens repeatedly, if it is exceptionally novel or powerful, if we focus on it, can’t “get past it”, if it is associated with other memories, if it happens when we are younger, or any combination of the above. For the short-term memory to turn into a long-term memory, DNA transcription takes place to incur BDNF, which then writes the memory into long-term existence. This is called consolidation.\n\n&gt;Fear exists as a memory just like everything else, and is always associated with a context memory. For example, a bell chimes and a mouse gets its foot shocked. The memory of the foot shock and the fear surrounding it will be associated with the memory of the bell chiming. Furthermore, because the bell chime and the foot shock were fairly novel and created pain and fear, the memory will likely be written into long-term memory, even if just weakly. One memory for the fear, one for the shock, one for the bell, and these memories will all be associated with each other across areas of the brain, so that when one is recalled so will the others.\n\n&gt;Now for the interesting part about long-term memories. Every time a long-term memory is recalled, it is reactivated, opened up again to transcription, and then reconsolidated through transcription by BDNF, exactly the same way it was first turned from a short-term memory into a long-term memory. This moment of recall opens the memory up to contextual modification, and strengthens the memory during reconsolidation. The more a memory is recalled and reconsolidated, the stronger the memory and its associations will be. The first couple times it is recalled and reactivated, it is more open to contextual changes because it is newer and weaker.\n\n&gt;Let’s look back at our mouse model… A bell chimed and the mouse got shocked, so he made long-term memories of the bell, the shock, and the fear. Not very strong memories, but strong enough to be remembered. Then, a bell goes off again and the mouse gets shocked again. This time, the event is not novel, it is recognized, and the same long-term memories that were made the first time are recalled, reactivated and deemed to indeed be significant. Transcription occurs to reconsolidate the memories, and the memories are strengthened. Say this happens 10 times… by then that mouse has really learned that a bell means a shock, to the point that next time there is a bell that little mouse is going to be scared shitless whether there’s a shock or not.\n\n&gt;In fact, there is a correlation in humans between the time a long-term fear memory has been in existence and how hard it is to overcome. The older a fear memory is, the harder it is to use clinical fear extinction methods to overcome the fear. In most cases, the fear memory becomes stronger whether the trigger is still there or not, because the fear memory is so strong that whenever it is recalled and reconsolidated, the additive effect of reconsolidation is always greater than the realization that there is no longer an actual threat, and that the trigger is in itself harmless.\n\n&gt;For example, the loud sounds of a city can bring up long-term memories that make an ex-soldier feel the fear from experiences in a war he or she was in. The recollected fear will always reconsolidate stronger than any realization of there actually no longer being any danger. This is an evolutionarily built-in safety mechanism. There have been many psychological studies done on this phenomenon, and it is mentioned in a 2016 research article on HDAC inhibitors and mice like this: “Recent fear memories were found to attenuate quickly on fear extinction training and no sign of fear response recurred after 30 days. Though remote (month old) memories also reduce after fear extinction training, the cue or context-triggered fear responses have been found to re-emerge after 30 days. Hence behavioral training is not alone sufficient to reduce remote fear memories.” Other studies show that with strong or long-past fear memories no amount of fear extinction training will work, and that, no matter what, the memory will resurface and continue to grow, or at least maintain, depending on how active the PTSD sufferer is combatting triggers. This is why those suffering from PTSD often must be prescribed medication, even with thorough counseling. Now, with recent advancements in this arena, we have more efficacious and lasting solutions for these problems, including HDAC inhibitors.\n\n&gt;Here is where HDAC inhibitors come into play. Remember that the window of reactivation isn’t open long enough to allow the updating of the emotional response to a trigger? What if we could hold that window open longer, so that we could overcome the fear memory associated with the trigger with a non-fear memory in one fell swoop? It just so happens that this is exactly what HDAC inhibitors do.\n\n&gt;When you take an HDAC inhibitor and “get rid of” a fearful memory, you’re actually not getting rid of it, you’re downplaying it. The present is prioritized, overshadowing any grossly inflated fear memories. The downplayed old fear memories will go through “long-term depression” and wither away. What this whole mechanism feels like in real-time while on Vorinostat is essentially “nothing”. You feel like you have no emotional baggage tied to the present moment, and you are all of a sudden free to make what you want of it. The HDAC inhibitor holds open the transcription window during memory formation, enabling the real-time reevaluation of the old memories, and the ability to strongly consolidate the present moment into long-term memory. This double whammy makes sure the present moment is prioritized. HDAC inhibitors, while on them, also let you more deftly analyze any situation you’re in due to nearly everything during the session being written into long-term memory in one way or another. This allows for a relatively extraordinary amount of learning power. They give you not only a clean-slate emotion-wise, but the memory power to make more intelligent decisions. This is related to HDAC inhibitors’ memory-enhancing effects, which we’ll talk about later.\n\n&gt;Let’s take a look at how to actually use an HDAC inhibitor for fear extinction, as in, what a session would look like. We have two choices: one, an experiential session, and two, a meditative, introspective session. They are both efficacious, but differ in character. No matter if you are in a place in real life or in your mind, the memory mechanisms are the same. Being in a place in real life may lead to a more thorough exploration of the triggers in that context and their related memories. This would be good for, say, if you are afraid of crowded places like a city. Simply go to a city on Vorinostat, and you will see that the HDAC inhibitor indeed works. However, if you have a harder-to-reach fear, a more esoteric fear, or some form of existential fear, a meditative approach would be best, delving into the memories and/or ideas. If you have several fears you’d like to delve into during one session, meditation would be good for this. I think what is best for most people is a combination of both approaches.\nMemory\n\n&gt;HDAC inhibitors really shine when it comes to the realm of memory and learning enhancement, especially when it comes to making and breaking habits or habit-like processes. I use “habit-like process” for a system that takes a strong and efficacious long-term memory to be able to learn. These are things that, on average, children have an easier time learning, like language, perfect pitch, and vocabulary. Children are better and more in the habit of consolidating and modifying their long-term memory in order to build systems in their mind to understand and interact with the world around them. Adults may have a better one-off long-term memory (sometimes), but children are better at building these larger systems of understanding, simply because they have bigger and more things to learn than do adults, not to mention a child’s biology is operating at a different level than an adult’s to begin with.\n\n&gt;If you take an HDAC inhibitor, however, this child-like quality of plasticity is opened up to you, and you are able to learn things like perfect pitch or an instrument as easily as a child would, if not easier. The HDAC inhibitor does this through the same mechanism that allows us to overcome trauma -- by holding open transcription to allow present circumstances to be written into long-term memory efficiently and powerfully.\n\n&gt;This is obviously great for things like learning an instrument, vocabulary, scientific literature, studying for a test, ecetera. Things can get deeper and more subtle that this, however...\n\n&gt;These memory effects go great with social interaction and various types of social anxiety, or even something as simple as keeping your cool and having good word recall during an interview. Along with the social habits we made as we were growing up, some of the habits or even fears that are brought up in us while we interact socially can be connected to weird things from our early childhood, and those subtle habits and fears are very hard to touch. With an HDAC inhibitor, however, even these deep-seated fears, anxieties, and habits in general, are up for grabs (but may take several sessions to fully extinguish/revamp to prevent relapse, according to animal models. But, the special thing about HDAC inhibitors is that you can even get to these deep-seated memories in the first place.). \nThe HDAC inhibitor drops any emotional baggage at the door, and gives you the ability to use the present as well as past memories to form new ideas about vocabulary use, body language, facial expressions and more, in real-time, allowing you to dramatically revamp, recondition and update your social habits. Situational awareness is enhanced.\n\n&gt;General Disclaimers: HDAC inhibitors work subtly. HDAC inhibitors do not blunt your emotions. Nor do they need to bring up emotions to extinguish them. They don't cause a relapse of anything. Quite the opposite, actually. They're fear extinguishing and mental effects are felt in real-time. They do not make you forget anything. Indeed, they actually help you remember things.

I imagined the teddy bear as a dead animal that the child had smothered.  I asked myself how I could have allowed it to get to this point.  I felt shame and disgust.  Thinking about all the times in my life I chose comfort over taking initiative.  My inaction was causing suffering.  I was the problem.\n\nStep 4:\nThe gears turned.  I was fully aware that I was experiencing something cathartic.  When I opened my eyes I could almost see through objects and visualize the internals, cell by cell.

I understood i have to change my mindset i started to think what i have to do. After short time i got into athene again i started to applying into my life what he was saying i started to make sense, i was eating healthy and exercising. My decisions were based on what made most sense for me and all this happend from one day to another and i was sure i clicked. It was 8 months ago and a lot happend, my Gf wanted to make sense as well and our relationship got even better. For me every inside was very easy to apply and to understand. I wanted to change world and help others. I even applied to join the crew but in respond they told me that i need more life experience. After this i continued self develop and helping others and my Gf to get the click.  Today i msged Athene on skype and he said i didn't clicked yet. I was really confused because all the symptomes were actually there and i applied all the insides so how i didn't clicked yet? I was really wondering what i have missed but i couldn't get that. I contacted clicker on discord and i shared my \"story\" he said that it might be that on emotional lvl i still value love to my GF more(since all this began with getting with her). I considered this but we talked with my GF and i told her that is she would stop making sense and start draging me down we would have to brake up. So i continued thinking and i started watching the stream. I was talking to one of the viewers and even there i was responding to all his question with all the logical thinking symptomes and i couldn't wrap my head around this situation and i knew that either im really close to real click all this time or im clicked already but i cant explain it properly.\n\nAnd after i was thinking about my life out of nowhere it came to my mind! Even before i met my gf i was looking for \"goal\" in life something that i would achieve. After i met my GF my goal changed to change the world and help people BUT ON THE EMOTIONAL LVL I WAS STILL CONNECTED THE MOST TO THIS \"GOAL\" THING. Thats why i was emotionaly stable because all this time i just wanted to make a difference and thats all rational thinking from the past made it easy for me to understand all insides. But at the same time my emotional part was sitting in far corner and i was not paying enough attention to it since i though i control my emotions. My core value got in line with making sense but the real click never happened. \n\nIt was like nuclear bomb crushed in my brain, there was no useless thoughts. My mind got clear i fel happy and wanted to cry in same time. Boost of energy came even my hands were shaking from excitement. First thing that came in my mind was to go and share it on discord with person that helped me and then i immidiatly msged athene.\n\nI hope that this gonna be helpfull.","createdAt":1477431138,"score":6,"author":"doesntmatch","id":"59dpgw"},{"title":"My Personal Experience","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/59g40h/my_personal_experience/","selftext":"It's the holidays, at this moment I think I have accepted comfort as a core value and I experience no dissonance because everything that I do is literally in line with comfort.

Which isn't controlled by a self directly, which means excluding the environment. A self controlling and understanding the input from the environment to create output makes no sense, because if the environment didn't give input in the first place there wouldn't be the illusion of a \"controlling\" action.\n\nThe current brain state can be summed up in a calculation of figuring out one's most important value or core value. So when brain state has changed due to steps 1 - 4 as they are, the calculation might turn out logic instead of whatever was before. It doesn't make sense that we have a strong self, a story and an arrow of time of our lives because it depends on our brain-state in the now. So what I said above as core emotional value is more accurate to be said a certain brain state.\n\nThis makes sense to me because someone who hasn't directly thought of what is their *most important value* approaches it with wonder, as if it is a completely new calculation and that it takes time. It might even take very long due to dishonesty and mistrust to oneself and making up core values. A duality between emotional-rational sure brings the latter.\n\nThose who have clicked also think differently so it reinforces the belief that our core values are the sum of a calculation depending on our brain state.

Just study theoretical physics (and then biochemistry) to see how simple initial conditions logically create an entire universe.\n\n\n**Logic has arms and legs**\n\nLogic created the universe. The universe is an expression, or embodiment of logic: everything in the universe is a physical manifestation of logic. So every person, every part, every head and arm and leg is logic made flesh.\n\n(Of course, each of us is only a small part of the big picture. So we can appear to be wrong about things, just as one side of an equation is unbalanced.)\n\nIf a person talks and acts in a logical, then we say \"that is a logical person.\" So that person is a part of logic, and logic is part of the person. Jesus said something similar about God (see below)\n\n\n**Logic has desire**\n\nWhen a person or other complex system tends to move in a certain direction we say it has a desire to do so. For example, logic leads to its conclusions, and we say a graph \"tends toward\" a particular direction. Even the simplest particle of matter has inertia: a desire to continue at its present velocity. So everything has desire.\n\n\n**Logic has morality**\n\nLogic creates the universe, including living things. Living things must logically want to survive (otherwise they would be quickly replaced by those who do). Logically, we survive best through cooperation. Methods of cooperation are known as morality: we see the other person's point of view, help the tribe, do not kill or cheat, etc.\n\n\n**Logic cares for us**\n\nFor us to exist, the universe (a creation of logic) has provided for all our needs. Giving someone al they need is called caring for them.\n\n\n**Logic is love**\n\nThe first letter of John contains this extra definition of God:\nHe that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.  (1 John 4:8)\n\n'Love' is the Greek \"agape\" meaning brotherly love: that is, treating others like ourselves. That fairness makes a society stronger because they enable the most efficient use of resources. In other words, \"agape\" is logic: the logic of survival (and its bi-product, a happy society).\n\n\n**Logic will answer our questions**\n\nIf you have a question use logic and you will get the best possible answer.\n\n\n**Logic loves you personally**\n\nFor the best chance of survival, every member of the tribe (or family) matters. So logically you matter, personally. (And if you sacrifice your life for your tribe or family and that is the logical thing to do, don't worry: your consciousness will survive.\n\n\n**Logic has a sense of humour**\n\nHumour is that which provokes laughter: usually through combining the unexpected or absurd. The universe is full of such humour.\n\nHunter gatherers, who live close to nature, laugh frequently. Scientists who truly love their field often laugh at the pleasure of some unexpected thing. Devout skeptics like Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett made a career out of laughing at the universe. Even mathematicians take a childish delight in particularly pleasing discoveries: Logic is always throwing up the unexpected: it loves to play tricks. So logic has a sense of humour.\n\n\n**Logic gives moral certainty**\n\nLogic is always constant and unchanging. In contrast, any current evidence, such as scientific findings or interpretation of a holy text, is subject to the possibility of change. If we base our ideas on anything except logic then our ideas are relative to something that might change. But logic itself does not change: it is the standard by which everything else is judged.

Make sure you have built enough trust in logic**\n\nOne of the reasons for unclicking might be because you haven’t built enough trust in logic, therefore if you experience certain emotion and you are not able to explain it , it will cause tremendous dissonance and loss of trust.\n\n**2. Rethink your core value**\n\nWhat can also cause falling back is the lack of understanding of your true core value, which might be the reason you couldnt explain your emotions.\nWhat helps a lot is to think about your life from childhood and ask yourself: “Why i did what i did? What was the emotion that drove most of my actions throughout my life?”. Try to think of positive and negative experiences and try to link them with one core drive that connected them all.\n\n**3. Rewire the fear of going through the same experience**\n\nWhat will likely happen is that you will remember the experience of adopting logic as fearful, especially if you felt anxiety when you were falling back into your old core value. The way to fix this is to go into your core and explain your inner child that it was not logic’s fault but rather the lack of trust and understanding and your old core value being too strong. That way you will remove the fear of adopting logic and going through it again. Make sure to do this only after you've built enough trust in logic.\n\n\n**4. Don’t tackle emotions, build trust first**\n\nIf you manage to re-click, it is important to not get stuck in trying to explain all your fears and especially not traumas. It’s more important to build trust by gathering knowledge and building strong framework. \nIf you experience fear and anxiety remember that those are just remnants of the past and it’s normal that you still experience them, it takes time for your neural network to fully rewire.","createdAt":1477247663,"score":3,"author":"xlugia","id":"58zyp9"},{"title":"Core value of strive for self-improvement and not enough trust in logic.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/591frw/core_value_of_strive_for_selfimprovement_and_not/","selftext":"So, a few months ago I started watching as much as I can of Athene's real talk videos. After every video, I meditated and through that I realised my existence had been flawed up to that point - it was non-productive and shallow. I realised that my core value was comfort and it was flawed on every level possible, so I pushed that away, after which I started looking for another core value. Since I am in my teens, I decided to set 3 values to live by.\n\n1. Leave an impact. (on the world, it can be as small as helping somebody and being remembered by him, small acts like that will build a fortune of those. I do not want to work a 9-5 job, I want to improve myself every day and do interesting, world-changing stuff...)\n\n2. Self-improvement/Build yourself. (now this is the most important as I feel this is my true core value as of now. It is really driving every decision I make on a subconscious level. I am in pain? How do I process the pain so that the experiences leaves me a better person? That is my thinking right now. I am doing non-productive bullshit? I experience dissonance as soon as I realise it and start studying and feeding my curiousity for science instantly. The bad aspect: I can realise it is making me somewhat asocial, as I'm forcibly ending contact with people I feel can't contribute to my self-improvement and I do not want to interact with them. I do not want to help them. I just want to ignore them completely.)\n\n3. Question everything (now this I feel most distant from my 3 core values. I feel like I DO NOT question everything. I take everything except relationships for granted I think. Relationships with friends and family I am truly thankful for and I feel it on an emotional level. Anyway, I think if I can make this my primary core value instead of 2., I can make the click.)\n\nI feel like I maybe don't have enough trust in logic, because when I think about my future, about what will dictate my life, I literally think \"Will logic tell me what is right for me and lead me to the impact I want to leave?\" Maybe I do not understand the concept of logic, or I can't fathom the core of it. I have been trying to think rationally my whole life, but is that really logic? My curiosity is huge, I want to know how the world works and how the greatest minds that have ever lived processed information and so on. \nI am being torn apart for what I want to study and do later in my life, so \"Self-Improvement\" seems like the closest thing I can tie myself to.\n\nAnother question I ask myself... Is self-improvement really my core value? In retrospect it is literally the code I live by, every decision I make is tested by my concept for self-improvement before I make it.\n\nBeing 100% honest to myself, right now, I think logic is more of a tool than a core value.(I can explain everything through logic - the source of my problems and possible solutions, my curiosity, etc, but can that really drive me forward?)","createdAt":1477265183,"score":0,"author":"c0ck7aiL","id":"591frw"},{"title":"Emotionally unstable pls help","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/58y0jk/emotionally_unstable_pls_help/","selftext":"Hello!

You can emotionally value logic more and more (in any method you can eg. watching cosmos or fractal documentary) and eventually and put it ahead of your current core value in the race and make your inner child choose logic because it provides more safety than your previous core value.\n\n[Visual for 2](http://i.imgur.com/Fl9S612.png) \n\n2. Or you can create dissonance with your current core value and create negative emotions with that value to push it down in the race to be the most loved value and once that value is lower than your second most \"safe\" value, your inner child will grab onto that value and make it the new core value.\n\n\n\nOnce this occurs and either your core value is pushed below logic or logic is pushed above your previous core value.\nYou have to strengthen your faith in logic to make it seem safer than the other values by a huge margin so your inner child does not doubt if logic is the safest.\n[Visual](http://i.imgur.com/IC9uW2r.png)\n\n\n\n\nSo that is it, just something that was clear to me that was not clear previously and I wanted to make sure everyone else got it clearly.

I have been trying to click for the past two/three days by : thinking about my behaviour, past events, meditating on it, talking with a friend in the same case as me (basically poking each other), skyping with other guy such as re-x, etc.\n\n\nCurrent situation : so far, I've been able to see that I was subconsciously lying to myself on the source of most of my actions, and basically seek validation on a daily basis. I can point to distinct actions and realize I did them only for validation, on an intellectual level. As for the emotional level, I can pinpoint the emotion that drives me before/during such actions, a kind of vague, warm feeling of excitment as I anticipate futur validation.\n\n\nHowever : Bachir, Ricardo and others mentionned that validation seeking is just a symptom and that one must dig deeper to something probably related to low self-esteem. Although I can conceptualize this, I have a really hard time going into this underlying layer. I just don't feel like I have low self-esteem, although I'm aware that it might just be the core trying to protect what it holds.\n\n\nFurther info for context : I'm a young scientist and as a result had to develop a strong rational part and critical thinking. I've been listening to the real talk for several years, all the way to the talk on the couch with reese &amp; athene. As a result I already began to change my life quite a lot for several months now (eating vegan, workout, cutting bullshit, etc etc). But this is on a rational level, the core is still not logical. It feels like I just have developped an over-powered rational part that course-correct a lot of things before actions, although what flows subconsciously isn't logical. As a result, I have a confortable life that makes \"some\" sense, and I have so much validation on a daily basis that it's just not something I consciously care about.\n\nLong story short : confortable life already logical on some level + strong rational part that constantly auto-correct (strong duality)\n\nI need solutions to create dissonance and dig deeper into core value ! you have anything to propose ?\n\n\nEDIT : I forgot to mention : as for step one, right now it seems like a no brainer to me.

I was really believing into this *before* the click, as I watched most of Athene's videos from the beginning and trusted him, I thought this could not be a scam.\n\nAfter watching the stream for 5+ hours straight and finding out more about the click here on the subreddit, I *really* tried the steps, I really wanted it to happen as I was a logical person on the rational part of my brain all the time. I like maths, science, computer science etc. so I did not have a hard time with loving Logic in Step 1.\n\nIn the next Step, I eventually found out that my core value was **Comfort**, playing WoW and Counter Strike all day, having that dream of writing games and apps (which I was doing as well, but most of the time I played games and wasted time). This is a crucial Step towards replacing the core value with Logic.\n\nAfter having done Step 3 of turning Comfort into something **negative**, I eventually reached the Paradigm Shift. I kept looking at objects in my room with wide open eyes, seeing the beauty in everything and feeling happy and extremely curious. I literally kept looking at diecast cars (is this the right term? Basically small cars of plastic / metal) in my room and tried to grasp the science behind it. It was really crazy and awesome at the same time.\n\nThis happened after watching the stream and videos for too long, as well as reading through reddit posts. It was very late in the evening, so I decided to sleep. My thoughts were still there a lot, but I had no real problems falling asleep.\n\nNow in the next morning, I was confused. I almost forgot about all the Logic stuff. I did not feel \"enlightened\" or anything. Just after a few hours, it came back into my mind and I opened up youtube and the stream again, as I figured something must be wrong, this is not it. Did I really have *\"the click\"*? I found out the third Step would take me quite a while. I had a call with Rex who was pushing me into the right direction, saying I should eventually have a call with Athene. So I asked in the Twitch Chat whether he could help me make the click, and he responded very fast with yes. I recorded it if it is valuable to anyone. However, he cleared up my questions about Step 3, I just did not understand how to make Comfort *a negative emotion*. After I understood that and took some time for myself watching the stream, meditating to classical music (wtf? I've never done that before in my life lol), and eventually ....\n\n.... nothing happened.\n\nI just went to Cs: Go with friends of mine who were asking and pushing me all day. *\"Where have you been?\" \"We were waiting all day!\"*\n\nI told them about the click and Logic (which was a mistake! Do not tell friends and family too early, they will think you are crazy!) and they first started laughing and did not take it seriously. I still kept holding on to the concept of clicking, not caring about what they were saying. And suddenly, after playing a few rounds (a matter of minutes), **I felt dissonance**. It was so weird, I can only identify it now as dissonance. At that point, I was just confused as I thought I did not make the click. It was a warm, unconvenient, almost a bit hurting feeling in my stomach that told me I was doing the wrong thing and wasting time. I basically had an urge to do something else. Unfortunately I played the game until the end and opened up the stream again afterwards. \n\nLying in my bed, I had a deep conversation with a friend of mine via mobile who played the round of Cs: Go with me earlier that day. I tried explaining the click to him, how it will affect and change the world, the benefits of it. But he did not quite understand. We had two different perspectives and two different levels of knowledge about this stuff, so I told him after an hour or two that it would not make any sense and he should watch the video and invest time himself to understand the click. We went both to sleep, but I just could not. \nI felt so much happiness, such an urge to spread the click all of a sudden, that I went to the subreddit and answered questions. My thoughts were spinning in my head like crazy, thinking about all kinds of questions. Thinking about how I would have gone through life if I had Logic as my core value since the start, as well as about life itself right now. I stayed in bed and tried to sleep, telling myself *\"I need rest. I need rest. I need rest.\"*, but it would just not work, even if it seemed logical to rest. I felt like I could really think for the first time, but it was not in my control. It was probably because the click was fresh and new. So many thoughts spinning in my head like crazy. I made a seperate little reddit post about it, you can check it out: https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/58y34o/how_do_you_even_sleep_after_the_click/\n\nI eventually stayed awake the whole night, and in the next morning, even though I felt tired and a bit loss of sleep, it was not like normal. I immediately wanted to do logical things like crazy. How I felt was different, also how I behaved. That day (which is *today*, the day when I posted this) I watched documentaries all day, had an urge to spread it, an urge to learn, an urge to understand everything, how life works from the very smallest bit to the largest bit, quantum mechanics, neuroscience and more. My parents needed help cleaning the house, so I figured it was the most logical thing to do, as resisting would cause only trouble and would be illogical. If I support my parents, it will be done faster, and the house is clean. While cleaning, I had a big urge of reorganizing my environment. I *really* wanted to throw away unnecessary stuff that I never really noticed in my room, but it was there. Like some Star Wars figures, weird decoration that did not really fit in here and were useless etc. I really felt happy about it, I organized lots of documents and so on, it was rewarding for the first time in my life to clean my room.\n\nAs I have an urge to restructure my life and my environment, I do need to take some time for myself and figure things out. However, it could be useful to someone who has questions to have a talk if I find time, you can add me on Skype. I am really curious where this will be going in the future, also how much I will change, or if I will fall back to my old patterns and core value (which I highly doubt).

It's mostly only motivation in my life and everything that I accomplished was because I wanted to prove others I'm better than them. If I didn't have this core value my life would have 0 sense and I wouldn't be able to do anything. There are also other core values like safety and comfort but I can ignore them when validation becomes important - I trade both of them to prove myself I'm better person and my life is worth.\n\nFor example my friend was better programmer than me and it made me sad so it pushed me forward and thanks to that I learned programming even more. But if I used logic then I would say to myself \"He is better programmer, there is no reason for me to learn it. Since he is my friend I can ask him for help with programming once I'm gonna need it. It will save my time and I don't have to learn anything. It's better for me to learn something he might needs help with and then we can help each other.\"\n\nBut then I would realize that my friend can disappear. He can die, he can be sick. Anything can happen to him and then reason why i learned something else to help him becomes unlogical and I would feel depressed about that I did something wrong and my life won't make sense again.\n\nAlso if I want logic to be my core value then I would have to understand everything so I could justify why I should do something. Like I would have to literally know what's gonna happen in the future so I can be sure I won't die and for example thinking about my plans for today could make sense thanks to that.\n\nAnd to realize logically I won't die this day I would have to consider and know about so many things it's even unreal to know them all. It means my life is unpredictable and it doesn't make sense to plan anything and start to do any big project - shorter goals = bigger chance for success but there is still that small chance something can ruin my plans so logically I have to get rid of all those issues first. \n\nI know you might complain this is \"probability\" but you said that logic created everything and if I'm not mistaken probability is just us not knowing something for sure. So logic would force me to confirm that there is no meteor coming to Earth before I even go take a shit and it's just one of many things that I would confirm before doing another action would make sense. \n\nSo for me it makes sense to listen to core values like safety because it allows me to do things faster. Thanks to safety I don't have to waste my time on thinking about going to take a shit in my bathroom because there is really low probability of happening something bad. If I used logic I would be always nervous if i visited bathroom just like that because I would ignore problems that can happen while I go there.\n\nI just feel like everytime I start to think logically I want to kill myself after I stuck in infite loop.

For my whole life I had a social anxiety, I feared of open conversation  and the last relationship that went to hell left me pretty emotionaly unstable so I also carried many bad emotions as a burden day and day out and I was living under constant stress. So you can assume that I am a introvert type of person.    As Athene came with the whole ''Making Sense'' thing I tried to adapt it and use it as a tool to overcome my fears, social anxiety and I even tried to ''switch'' from introvert to extrovert. \n\nI have to say that this whole proccess lasted like a week although I was really dedicated, but after the week it just faded. And now I know that it was because of I rationally wanted to change, but since my Core value was comfort, on the emotional level I did not change anything. So after that I was going with my ''core comfort value'' deeper and deeper. I played PC games 24/7, and if I didnt I was just wasting time scrolling thru facebook and laughed about stupid memes.\n\nYesterday, I found Athene's newest video Logic Nation. I watched it as I came bored from the school and I was like ''whoah, maybe this is the thing that I didnt had the last time I tried to change'' because it answered some questions that I had the last time. I tried to elaborate and reflect on it for few hours, then went to sleep. Next day when I woke up, the first thing that I thinked about was how I can do logic things thru out the day and how Am I supposed to see logic behind everything, I was really confused about it and ofcourse it caused even more dissonance that I had before ( since I wanted to change my life rationaly, on emotionaly). I tried to ask some questions on Athene's stream but unfortunately I did not get answer) so I started going thru the subreddit and found a post from user with nickname Re-x.I contacted this guy on Skype and we talked about everything that I didnt had answer for (Thanks again If you are reading this :D ) and after that, I knew it is completely on me. I knew, that emotionaly I still desire comfort and that comfort is my core value, so the step 2 was done for me instantly. Step one was I think the hardest one because even after the conversation, I haven't seen logic under everything, but after a walk in woods and really deep thinking (also watching some videos) I made the sense of Step one and now I know that I believe in Logic as whole.So with the step two already done, after quite some time of self reflecting and convincing myself that the Comfort core value is bad, wrong and doesnt gives me any safety rather than ''decaying me from inside'' I was able to let go, and it was a huge relief because suddenly all my fears, anxieties were gone, and the past that I was carrying behind me aswell. I felt immense joy and from nothing I was driven to understand things. I also felt desire to know more about quantum mechanics, more about the world in general and more. Anyway now I know that I have to feed the new core value and that I need to keep going to fully make sense out of everything. I want to help anyone else that is confused about anything as they are trying to ''click''. \n So if anyone needs help feel free to and me on Skype: mafioso622 and we can talk about it.\n\nThanks for reading.","createdAt":1477159450,"score":7,"author":"adkn1337","id":"58uc4y"},{"title":"Is this my core value?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/58v1t8/is_this_my_core_value/","selftext":"I tghought about if for 3 day now and im very certain that my core value is seeking attention and validation from others because i dont feel good enough on my own.\n\ni came up with that like this: First i knew my daily drive is money... ever decision i make is based on my future income chances--- Then i thoguht i want the money to buy nice cars and a nice house --- Then i knew that the most value by owning these things i get from others admiering it and admiering me-- Then i knew i am seeking vallidation from others how good i am--- Then i came to the conclusion that i must feel not good enough on my own.. was the thought prosses here right?

I created a lot of dissonance and thought about how comfort is a flawed core value and how it goes against itself. But I somehow couldn´t make the transition to making-sense/logic.\nMy click happened when Ricardo talked about his former core value “gaining value“. It might sound a bit confusing to some people but he explains it here at 1:39:45 https://www.twitch.tv/athenelive/v/95371855.\nI reflected on it and realised that I had the same problems like low self-esteem and feeling like you are worth less then others. I tried to compensate by gaining value in order to feel some kind of self worth. To be more specific, I looked at it through my lense of social conditioning and tried to gain value by doing illogical things like playing music, going to university, buying certain clothes or going to the gym only to build muscle. I grew emotionally attached to them (especially to music) because I thought these were the only things/actions that could provide value for me and make me feel better about myself.\nThe way I clicked was by creating a lot of dissonance around my old core value and giving a strong positive emotion to logic. I compared gaining value to logic and realised how I try to stimulate my reward center with all these superficial things/actions that in reality don't give me any real value. Furthermore, I might fall in a deep hole if I wouldn't be able go to the gym due to an injury or drop out of university due to a failed exam. I realised that everything that I thought would give me value was just a product of social conditioning and that for example I woudn't be playing an instrument if I weren't born in the current time and society. \nLogic, on the other hand, is the thing that can give me the most value. By doing what is logical (e.g. moving forward, helping others, making a difference) I will have more value, more meaning in life and feel way better about myself. At this point I made the click.\nI started to feel the typical symptoms like the warm feeling in your chest, dopamine rush, my problems dissapeared, being more clear headed and a need to spread it. At this moment I literally felt like I could overcome any obstacle and I found myself unable to sleep for hours due to all the thoughts that poped-up in my head.\nOver the next 2 day my dopamine decreased and I started feeling anxiety and dissonance. At one point I even went back into old habits and stimmulated my “old“ neural pathways which caused my dissonance to overwhelm me and completely interrupted my logic-flow.\nI felt at my worst and came to the conclusion that I must have experienced a placebo click.\nIt was the new video “LOGIC NATION: A Psychological Revolution“ that helped me to understand  \nthat my trust in logic is not big enough yet and I therefore don't feel safe with it. I still need time to rewire myself. I tried to stimulate my new logical pathways by always asking myself “what is the most logical thing you can do right now?“ and acted according to my conclusions. Furthermore, I thought about how logic brings about all my safety (e.g. medicine, my parents house, family). The anxiety and dissonance greatly decreased and my trust in logic went up.\nCurrently I'm working on increasing my trust in logic by listening to the stream/podcasts, watching Cosmos and trying to logically explain my dissonance when it comes up.(By the way I appreciate any feedback by you guys on how I can increase my trust in logic more)\nI hope this can maybe help someone.

In my free time, I could still catch myself watching TV or whatever, in the need for entertainment, and 2 days ago I was in a bad mood, when I turned on Athenes stream, and he was showing the video 'Logic Nation'. It made me click, which resulted in the release of dopamine, and I had to do logical things. First off I reinstalled my PC and deleted all bullshit from my phone - having it didn't make sense anymore, so it caused so much dissonance.

Not long after we set out to the remote venue I told her that I am looking for my core value and started bouncing ideas off her. Not long after we each named a few and had a few explanations I formulated the idea that my core value was \"perfection\". \n\nI was always striving to get to 100% at everything interesting to me, by biggest accomplishments are the ones where I thought I was closest to the top 100% and biggest failures was when I thought I failed miserably at being better than other people.\n\nAfter looking for exceptions to the rule and not finding any, I thought that's a pretty accurate definition of my core value. The feeling of pride, or success was the driving factor in almost every decision I made. \n\nTechnical skills such as rhetoric and critical thinking is really important if you want to either seem like you are better than everyone else, or if you want to generate proof of that believe for yourself. So I think my skills in using logic and reasoning was decent enough so step 1 was easy. I just opted to have faith in logic, and it made sense based on the assumption that logical rules underpin everything in the universe at every level of emergence or scale.\n\nQuickly after just sitting with the idea that my core value is striving to be perfect, I followed step 3, and with the same logic Athene uses in Real Answers I just reasoned the following: My need to be perfect stops me from becoming perfect. This is because I cannot tolerate anything that tells me I am not perfect. This blinded me to my own faults and errors I make. Effectively making me arrogant and extremely vulnerable and afraid of any criticism to the idea that 'I am perfect'. \n\nAfter reasoning on a few more occasions through the day that striving for perfection is not going to make me perfect, I attended the wedding and got smashed in the mean time.\n\nThe next morning with a pretty decent hangover, I noticed that I was able to think about things that elicit a fear response without terminating the thought or looking away from the thought or emotion. This is when I clicked*. \"My identity is gone\", I thought to myself. This is what I perceive to be selflessness. My identity was there to protect me from scary thoughts and emotions that might threaten my perfect status.\n\nThe rest of the day was really interesting, I was learning things about myself and other people at a rapid pace, but it didn't feel like effort. It just felt as though every time I feel something negative I just identify what and why I am feeling like that, and most of the time a solution presents itself or the anxiety about the emotion just dissipated. I thought: \"change everything you can't accept and accept everything you can't change\" is pretty close to my mindset now, the automatic response to everything I do. I broke my racial barrier (which is a big thing in South Africa), I fixed a deep problem with me and my mother's relationship, I faced fears like every few moments with staggering ease, and started thinking up solutions to everything in my life that's bothering me almost automatically. My life has definitely changed, and it was those four steps that did the trick. Thanks Athene and crew for doing your part, it's time for me to do mine. Good luck guys. \n\nSome biographical info (feel free to skip): I'm 21, student studying chemical engineering, recovering from drug induced psychosis and anxiety and depression, started using drugs when I was 18, broke my reward center and what else, took LSD with a broken reward system and experienced my identity dissapear, this was fuel to a fire that raged through my life for 2 years after that and nearly destroyed my future. The past two months my reward center has been recovering rapidly with medication, recently only antidepressants and cognitive therapy, also my lifestyle became healthy and I broke a keystone habit of smoking so the health related value popped into place, which helped a lot. My reward center will be completely fixed in about 4 months. I'm adding this because the click was made in a single day by a young me with a history of self destructive behaviors, drug abuse, and a slightly off balance biochemistry. So happily remove any doubts that you are not (yet) eligible for logic as a core value. \n\nYou are better at this than you think you are.\n\nTL;DR Watched Athene's video on the four steps. Googled how to find my core value. Identified my core value to be \"perfection\". Reasoned that striving for perfection stops me from achieving perfection since it doesn't allow me to look at my faults and errors. Next day I noticed while driving that my identity is missing (specifically I noticed I was able to think about things that elicit a fear response without terminating the thought or looking away). That's when I clicked. Also noticed a few profound moments scattered throughout the day of catharsis and other pleasant emotions. Fear has lost it's hold on my actions. My need to share this information quickly followed. Then I wrote this. Also, keep it up guys!\n\np.s. Also I have an idea for how to make a program or app that tests your probable core values. So anyone interested in coding and this idea can contact me, I believe this will simplify the four steps like crazy if it works.

Ok so family/human connection is my core value. I do not want to associate any dissonance with this. I think what makes us human is the need for love, human connection, and family. By having my family/human connection as my core value I want to be the best person I can be for them and it makes me the best version of myself I could be. I feel this is in us all as an instinct. When we don't have family/human connection we can become lonely and depressed. Now in order to cope with our depression that we might not understand why we have on a conscious level, because we aren't experiencing it, we can wire our dopamine to things such as logic. We are just tricking ourselves though and numbing ourselves down from the natural pain and loneliness that can come from being a human, something that is a cause for the human spirit and creativity. We can subscribe to all sorts of bubbles like logic is god to stimulate our reward system, but it wont ever fill the void left that family and love provides. Dopamine is different than oxytocin. putting logic as a core value instead of family turns us from a human to a robot. Do not run from pain, do not try and mask it, embrace it and accept it so you can actually fix it because logic cannot, but family, human connection and love can. What sounds more reasonable? Logic will provide your emotional fulfillment, or love and family will. The inner child Athene says wants to hold on to comfort as a teddy bear actually just wants to hold onto the ones he loves. why does a baby need its mother's touch when he is born? Then later the more rational part of the brain develops. So on a fundamental level before we have logic we have only our core value of human connection.","createdAt":1477144510,"score":3,"author":"reasonablepoint","id":"58t80v"},{"title":"How do i love logic","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/58t270/how_do_i_love_logic/","selftext":"How do i start loving logic, im too scared to start creating dissonance about my core value before i know il replace it with logic, how do i strenghten it so i know i wont cling on to something other when i remove my current core value?

Then one day whilst watching a Hearthstone stream for my entertainment I heard Reese talk about this audio book 'Power of Now' that helped him overcome his issues. I downloaded it one day (I think it was during summer holidays) and set up a challenge for myself to watch it all in one go... One hour passed, second one passed and I couldn't stop listening to the book as everything being said about my ego and how it is eating us alive was so true. Later on the book I learned how to properly meditate and rush blood flow into my brain (very important). One of the main principals that the book taught me was not to resist or try fight the ego and that by accepting it can I truly enhance the self, the harmony with the world. Half way through the book I've set up a second mental challenge for myself and was being in the present (now) for the rest of the day no matter how hard I'd like to fall back to my noise. Did this for about 5 hours straight. After all the noise was diminished, all ego and all my crisis i had accepted (not resisted or fought) in my mind I subconsciously rewired my essence with new harmonic one. (back then the concept of logic was unheard by me, it was a nameless emotion at that time). The sensation was something like this: I felt very proud (in a nice way) of myself for overcoming my ego by accepting it (back then concepts of clicking were unfamiliar to me) and I really wanted to share this discovery with everyone I knew as that single point of realization what I have done to myself was so beautiful I couldn't explain in words. My mood skyrocketed, I have only felt this dopamine rush (didn't know this word back then either) couple of times in my entire life thus I knew and felt amazing. I have finally cured my inner conflict with myself. Moments later I am very curious about my surroundings. I tried eliminating every possible source of noise from my life: music, games, pictures. Everything seemed like an unnecessary energy waste. I started thinking in solutions in every aspect of my life. I had genius business ideas flying in like crazy when I stumbled upon something that really didn't make much sense. I could design far better solutions that anything that we currently have (I thought that in my head). Then came the night... for 3 or 4 hours every single day for two+ weeks on I have spend rewriting flaws in my actions, 3 hours before falling asleep for 2 weeks! I was becoming a robot in everything I did, but most importantly stopped doing most of the tings that kept me occupied for the majority of my life (like games, bad relationships). This was all new experiences for me, but I felt lost... and lonely in a way that I might be the only one thinking this way. I call my good friend about it and want to share my accomplishments with him. He was happy for me but was not able to witness the power behind it.

In my opinion this means that you're doing things like:\n\n- adapting veganism, helping to normalize it and trying to spread it as much as possible (I don't see why this topic is being avoided so much on the stream)\n- stimulating pointless industries like smoking, make-up, shampoo, cars (petrol), etc. Makes you feel bad because it stimulates destruction of the whole and contributes to the inequality in the world. It's important here to focus on your circle of influence and not just soothing your conscience with donations or by comparing yourself to people that are less aware.\n- you care for your longevity and adapt the habits that are scientifically proven to enhance it. Someone that wants to improve the whole wants as much time as possible to do it and wants to see the future. I would go as far as saying that **the only rational fear is death**. In terms of diet this means a whole-foods plant-based diet with vitamin D and B12, protecting your adrenals by watching your caffeine intake and using spices and tea for extra antioxidants. The nutritionfacts.org search function is a goldmine and will help you with topics that you're doubting about. The whole site is based on pubmed and other peer-reviewed scientific literature wich is really important cause there's so much bullshit about food. Also make sure that you avoid stress, get enough sleep, some exercise and you want to look into meditation aswell. \n\nIn my opinion the best approach with these things is to always start with yourself. You first become it, adapt it and then spread it. That way there is no hypocrisy and you are the change you want to be in the world. \n\nAny suggestions, comments and criticisms always appreciated.

Im simply patched my core value with all athenes realtalks (admiting of that actualy did a lot of dissonance for me so its helpful for athene's old-timers). So the only warm feeling that i could relate with logic was the conclusion that logic helped me to be TRULY comfortable with my flawed core. I gained more validation by using logic, less social anxiety, more success overall (i had these moments in my life by using it). So this ez train of thoughts fucked up me later. When I cliked i had a bit of relief and SO MUCH dissonance. I started to search logic in everything. I couldn't sleep until morning. That was pretty painful.

Then I felt some kind of activity in my brain, it seemed like some kind of rewiring, don't know if it was euphoric, but it felt somewhat good and clear(I can't explain it). After this process started to calm down, I openned my eyes, my brain felt clearer than before and somewhat diffrent a little bit. Then I stood up and started to look at the symptoms if I had clicked.

Logic has allowed us to explore the solar system and outer space, to walk on the moon and send rovers to mars. Logic has created computers, the Internet and video games. Logic was responsible for our greatest feats and inventions, from cures to diseases to technologies that unified the whole world. Logic created all the emotions that exist. It gave you the opportunity to feel the love and warmth of your parents. It allowed you to find comfort and safety when times were hard and you had nothing more to rely on. Being aware of how logic is beautiful will allow you to grow your faith which will later help you with step 3 and 4.    \n\n2nd step: Find what emotionally drives you. \nBeing very honest to yourself is required in this process of reflecting and understanding why you did what you did in your life. Your emotional core value will often be traced back to the moment you submitted your will to what gave you safety and it is usually connected to the feeling of not being worthy or not able to take care of yourself. That is the reason why most core values range from fitting in to comfort. Be aware that the extent to which you are too comfortable with your current core value will decide whether you have an easier or harder time following through step 3.    \n\n3rd step: Realize that your current core value does not work for you. \nConnect it to a negative emotion in a similar process to how you would tell your inner child that what you are holding on to is not beneficial for your safety. Although rationality can help in increasing the dissonance, this process must happen on an emotional level, by discarding your current value and automatically holding on to logic instead. If you are able to reach to your emotional core, the paradigm shift usually happens instantaneously.    \n\n4th step: You will experience a catharsis that can last from an hour to a few days. \nThe first reaction will often be a strong urge to understand everything through logic, since that’s what brings you safety now. This is highly connected with the reward center of the brain, so it’s important to practice your logical abilities not only to strengthen and feed your faith in logic but also to override the old values. Since remnants of your past might still appear, your ability to deal with the dissonance they bring will depend on how well you already understand logic. Being aware of this will allow you to frame the dissonance logically and slowly but surely build up a stronger foundation in your life while tackling each issue one by one. Be cautious and don’t make the mistake of tackling strong emotional obstacles when your familiarity and faith in logic is low. When you do reach to conclusions, emphasize and reinforce how you can fully trust in logic. You can also strengthen your trust by being grateful for all the things logic provided to you, like eating, showering or enjoying anything in general. Anyway, since now you know you need to conduct logical actions to strengthen your new core value, trusting in logic will allow you to cope with the fear and anxiety you might experience better as you know it is logical and will always have a logical answer when allowing yourself to give it enough time.     \n\n\nFor people wondering what happens after you complete these four steps and make the click, here is a some of the side effects:  \n-The moment you click, you will experience a rush of dopamine in your brain, a euphoric feeling and a tremendous relief.   \nLater on,  \n-You will feel clear-headed, in the present and in a constant flow state  \n-You will feel driven to think logically and understand things  \n-You will experience selfless and choiceless awareness  \n-You’ll stop taking things for granted and you will find everything that surrounds you beautiful  \n-You will feel intrinsic confidence and a sense of empowerment  \n-You will appreciate reality for what it is, which will allow you to truly listen and understand the world from other people’s perspective  \n-All your problems will be gone suddenly as you start thinking in solutions rather than problems  \n-Your logic abilities skyrocket such as quicker pattern recognition and learning capabilities  \n-You will feel no burden, story or identity as duality ends and you don't need to think in 1st or 3rd person anymore  \n-You will have an urge to tell other people  \n","createdAt":1476993597,"score":49,"author":"Chiren","id":"58j0cw"},{"title":"Beauty of logic (short and easy)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/58mqti/beauty_of_logic_short_and_easy/","selftext":"Hey guys,\n\nI would like to share some thought process that I am currently experiencing at the moment. This may or may not be part of the click but I would to have as many opinions related to this as possible. So feel free to share your thoughts on this. Disclaimer: Athene mentioned that it is easier to figure out the beauty in logic on your our rather than to patch things up. I figured that my post may be a spoiler to some.\n\nThe first step for clicking is to understand the beauty of it. My first reaction was that logic was something that was meant to be done regardless of whether it's done by choice or auto pilot since it will eventually end up that way. Like how we fall sick due to bacteria and our weak immune system. This makes me believe that it has a cold and neutral state of presence. However, after reading some of the topics and replies that you guys have posted. I realized that there was more to it than accepting it as itself. Nature by numbers for example (I can't remember who posted it but you the man!), was a simple video on how numbers were used to create. My first usual blunt reaction was that it rather a pleasant video to watch but in reality, I didn't understand anything. From that video, I recalled the number pattern which I had learnt back in 2013. It was called the Fibonacci Sequence. From there I went to study more on that topic and after understanding some parts of it, the video actually makes more sense now. \n\nWhen Athene mentioned the beauty of logic, I was confused. My simple mindedness had visualized myself eating because I was hungry (logic). If I eat unhealthy food I will be unhealthy. If I eat too much good food, I will be fat. If I don't eat for more than 30 days, I will die. So I need a proper and balanced meal to look good (beautiful) and stay healthy. Which makes sense to a certain extend. But as I studied it further and realized that wasn't the case. Rather, it was about the Fibonacci sequence that was used in as an art form itself. I was stunned (mainly because I felt stupid). The feeling was exactly the same as submitting a careless mistakes after realized that you misunderstood the questions. \n\nArt has always been part of our lives. Be it buildings or even a sketch on a notepad. Throwing off topic for a bit to clear things up. When I was 10, there was this hero on TV. His name was Kamen Rider Faiz, also known as 555 or PHI. He had the same symbol Φ. When I came across this symbol as I was reading on it, it felt so nostalgic. Back to the topic. Φ  or PHI is the golden number. The measurements of beauty. The number is 1.618. This makes more it even more easier to understand what Athene's definition of the beauty in logic is. Φ is also used in octave in music and proportions in art. There's is another number but wasn't mentioned as important as Φ. It is Ψ or PSI and the number is 137.5 usually found in angles sequence in living organisms such as fruits and flower petals.\n\nJust imagine the sound that we hear, to the sights that we see. Then sync that all in to the Fibonacci Sequence. From flower petals to even tornado.\n\nI wanted to add in how fitting in is also part of the subject but I would not want to make this post long and draggy.\n\nMy intentions of making this post is just to ask for advice, thoughts and reactions. Maybe I had missed something out. Please advise me if so. I'm currently attempting to make the click, however I do have realistic priorities in life such as managing my finances before I could consider joining the crew. Otherwise I would end up being a burden to everyone.\n\nAnyway, let me know you're opinion on this as I would love to read on your thoughts as well.\n\nThank you everyone for reading this post.

I haven't watched Athenes streams/vids in a few years.\n\nAfter watching a few of Athene's videos I'm still not really sure what he's trying to say. It's a lot of vague terminology paired with vague steps, followed by all these amazing feelings you will experience once you will let go of your emotional desires? \n\nI'm not going to pretend like I know what I'm talking about, I don't read many scientific or philosophical texts. However, this seems very similar to Stoic philosophies of ancient Greece, just in a modern pseudo-intellectual package?\n\nI feel like I've lived my whole life with a want to understand how everything works. I was always a sceptic and only believed in things that had rational or scientific explanations. \n\nWhat is the purpose of \"Makingsense\"? If we detach ourselves from our emotional selves and our emotional drives, what is the point of doing anything? There is no logical explanation for wanting/liking to do something in life. A hopefully positive emotional response is the reason for wanting to do something. We can use logic to dictate our actions and analyse every scenario to come up with best possible outcome to benefit us in the current environment. Is that the point? We will ultimately just become robots making binary decisions for the ultimate goal of bettering our selves? Wouldn't that go against that whole act of selflessness Athene talks about?\n\nAlternatively, we won't need to do anything, because all the perceptions of success and comfort are social constructs and material possessions are only selfish needs as a quantifiable measure of success and ultimately tied to ego. \n\nI feel like I'm a pretty logical person already in most aspects of life. I guess I am emotionally driven by wanting to matter. I'm pretty introverted, so my friend circle is quite small. I would like more friends to do more social things. Due to my anti-social nature I probably use my appearance (fashion, taking care of my general appearance) as a way for others to validate me in my mind, without actually having to communicate. Along with my hobbies and career choices, which I guess are all sensory stimulants. (visual art, music, etc.) They rely on emotional responses, rather than logic. Ultimately I am afraid of failure and this creates a vicious circle of just not trying in the first place. \n\nApplying Athene's logic to my life, I will no longer have the desire to make friends, as I will be completely content being alone? The appearance if a very superficial thing, so It doesn't even matter. My hobbies/career will become obsolete as I no longer have any emotional drive towards them and no longer care how others view me, which is partially the reason I want to be successful. My fear of failure will no longer exist but if there is no need to succeed in the first place, it ultimately negates the effect.\n\nI understand that my emotional discomfort is the reason I make the choice of not going out and meeting people and not doing things I want to do. But I want to do those things for the same reason I don't do them, my emotional response. You can't have one without the other. \n\nOr is this more along the lines of rewiring your brain with positive reinforcement techniques, in order to eliminate negative emotions that are stopping you from achieving your goals? Which is ultimately a selfish act anyway.\n\nSorry for the long wall of text, just kinda spewed some shit on the page as it came. Not even sure how I would tl;dr this.","createdAt":1477005592,"score":5,"author":"CraftedPad","id":"58k2sa"},{"title":"My story/experience with the click and some tips","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/58jm1b/my_storyexperience_with_the_click_and_some_tips/","selftext":"Clicking = making logic as a core value\n\n\n**About me and my life before the click**\n\nI'm 20 years old and I come from Poland.\n\nSince I was 3 years old i was interested in computers and everything related to them. Games, programming, web development, operating systems, and a lot more were all my interests.\n\nAt the age of 8 I thought deeply about the death. I was afraid of it, it was one of the last moments when I cried. I didn't find the solution to the fear but somehow I forgot about it and moved on with my life.\n\nAt the age of 15 I bought a guitar. But it wasn't until I was 19 that I realised my strong attachement to music.\n\nAt the age of 16 I started smoking marijuana. I slowly realised that it is damaging me but I couldn't stop because of my environment. It lasted 2 years until I gave up my environment and stopped smoking completely.\n\nAt the age of 17 I started searching for answers. I got into conspiracy theories, aliens, religions. Finally I found a believe system that satisfied my core needs.\n\nAt the age of 19 I rediscovered Athene. I knew him before but I didn't have the full picture. I realised that all the things he does comes from a passion to do good (now I know it's making sense). Less than a month later the \"My Life As A Gamer\" documentary was released; after watching it I really wanted to know more about Athene. I started watching his streams. A year and a half later he started doing real talk. I instantly found it mindblowing and I accepted almost all things he says.\n\nAfter some time I started making sense. It lasted only two days because I didn't change on the emotional level. I felt that real talks are not longer benefitial to me bacause I had the information and Athene was just repeating himself. From now on I skipped a lot of streams.\n\n\n**Day 1** - The click day\n\nI did my usual stuff which was browsing Youtube and playing WoW, but at the time I was experiencing quite large dissonance. I knew I need to change my life but I felt I need some kind of impulse to do it.\n\nI started watching the stream. A thought pop up - logic gives me safety and comfort, I don't need anything else anymore. I realised that my believe system may be flaw because I looked at it as a absolute truth, and I would collapse if it turned out to be false (looking at my believe system in probabilities couldn't give me comfort). It was really emotional. I experienced a dopamine rush; it was the best feeling ever, much better than marijuana. I'm not sure if this is accurate: I transfered the positive emotion from my believe system to logic. From this moment I had desire to make sense all the time, and I did it. I instantly gave up all my emotional attachements - listening to music seemed like a waste of time, I lost the urge to create my own game. I wanted to spread it so I whispered people on Twitch that could be potential \"clickers\".\n\nAfter the stream I started thinking if I really clicked or not; I didn't figure it out. It was late so I went to sleep; falling asleep was hard.\n\n\n**Day 2** - Realisation\n\nI created a to-do list and started doing things from it. Almost whole day I did the most rational thing to do - mostly working, 0 games/entertainment, when I was tired I did something that stimulated me. I felt great all day even if I was exhausted after work because of dopamine. I experienced a small dissonance if I did something irrational, but I didn't bash myself about it and moved on.\n\nI found out that watching the stream is stimulating, so I did that. During the stream I came to conclusion that I truly clicked and logic is my core value on a emotional level. Again I had a trouble falling asleep.\n\n\n**Day 3** - Moving forward\n\nAgain I made sense all day and felt great. Even better than yesterday because I no longer had the doubts if I clicked. I couldn't believe how my life has changed since the click, it felt (and still feels) like a dream.\n\nAround 8pm I went to gamingforgood.net/s/athenelive. The stream was offline but I joined the chat, trying to help someone while waiting for Athene. After he went online I listened to the stream and kept talking with people.\n\nAthene wanted to have call with me but I rejected it. This caused insane dissonance - I had always had strong shyness/social anxiety and I feared that it can stop me from making sense. On the other hand I wasn't sure if talking to Athene was the right thing to do, because I wasn't prepared for it (I didn't know what to say), but maybe that was just a backwards realisation. It was late so I went to sleep, without issues this time (low dopamine level).\n\n\n**Day 4** - Extreme dissonance\n\nAs I woke up the dissonance from yesterday came back. I started reading \"Real Answers\"; the dissonance increased because I wasn't doing the right thing. I got to the point where I couldn't focus and even had a hard time breathing. I was so stressed only once in my life before, it was almost paralyzing. \n\nI realised that the only fix was to start making sense again. The dissonance ended as I accepted that calling Athene and coming over is the right thing (the most rational thing). I couldn't imagine losing logic so I had to do it.\n\nI started writing this text. I took some breaks from it and I spent quite some time on the subreddit, reading and answering. I realised that finishing this text is more important so I did that. I don't have any dissonance from no making sense before because it makes sense to focus on the now rather than on the past. My next steps is to get financially independent and apply, and before that having a call on the stream with Athene.\n\nI didn't have the time to be on the stream today. Possible that I won't have the time in the next 3 days because of stuff that isn't really dependent on me.\n\nI still don't know if my core value was safety or comfort, but it doesn't really bother me - it's gone.\n\n\n**Tips on clicking** - TL;DR\n\n[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drcseH-7hpw) - Everything said there it's true, I can relate to it.\n\nAsk yourself if do you really want to click. If you don't or you aren't sure, look at all the people that clicked and what it did to their lives, what's their reaction.\n\nChange clicking to your number one priority if it isn't yet.\n\nRead posts from people that clicked, try their methods.\n\nAccept logic on a emotional level, realise that it gives comfort, safety, anything you need or want.\n\nCreate a dissonance or embrace existing one.\n\nFind your true core value. Go deep.\n\nBe completely honest to yourself.\n\nWrite down your life.\n\n\nComing to the conclusion that logic is the best (core value or whatever) using logic/rationality is not clicking. You have to realise this on a fundamental (emotional) level. The click itself is purely emotional, and after it happens you have an instinct drive to make sense.\n\nThis will take over the world.\n\nSorry for my English.","createdAt":1477000170,"score":6,"author":"kamiz-","id":"58jm1b"},{"title":"I just clicked.(how I found bad core value included)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/58jy94/i_just_clickedhow_i_found_bad_core_value_included/","selftext":"I'm one of lukers in Athene's chat, I would follow podcasts and change my habits thanks to them.

I felt a burst of happiness and my stomach felt good also my heart was beating really fast. I realized that being comfortable is bad in the long run but also making my emotional part of my brain think that comfort is something negative, for example i sit on my pc all day and go to school. Now I realize how all of that is useless and I just got to make sense cause that's what I always wanted.

I just watched it and he explains the 4 steps for you to click there really well. A thing I took away from the video although I already clicked was that it's important to strengthen your neural pathways that makes sense and feed your faith in logic. Otherwise you might fall back to old habbits and you will experience a lot of dissonance. You strengthen the neural pathways by keep doing stuff that makes sense. For example I instantly went and spread my experience here on reddit since it makes sense to help others click aswell. Also I feel the urge to work out instead of sitting on my ass doing jack shit. I feel like I can do my school homework easy now since I know why I do it, I have a purpose. Eating healthy aswell, it just makes fucking sense. Every decision I make now fundamentally makes sense and since my emotional core is logic I'm in the present. I will just keep this flow going and if I find myself in a situation where I experience anxiety in the future, I will just face it with logic, does it make sense to experience social anxiety? No, so I intercept the emotion and reframe it by trusting in logic. It truly is beautiful.\n\nAlso as a sidenote, I'm generally not this bad at spelling.

So the way I was able to make the click was like this:\nI listened to the realtalk on the 14th october when reese and athene were talking about adopting logic as a god! and I could really resonate with that. Since i grew up in a religious household and I (even though it was irrational) always had the thought that there might be  \"higher power\" that controls everything.\nAt that moment i realised that there actually is a higher power! and its logic and as long as i follow it i will not get let down by it and my life will improve for sure! That was my rational part thinking that btw. So i looked at my core value which was comfort and validation seeking and really tried to look at the flaws of them like for example: Im just sitting here watching YT videos and having \"Fun\" while there are people dying and i could help them! and i put myself in the situation like what if i was the guy dying and some dude who could help me doesnt help me because he is too lazy!\nAlso at 1 point i would have to get out of this doing nothing mode anyways, like when my parents kick me out or something... But for some reason (even though i was feeling alot of dissonance) i couldnt make the click that night, but only when Tim talked about his expirence the next day. I think it was since i felt really connected to Tim and i saw how his life was improved by adopting logic as a core value that my emotional part also really wanted it.\nSo yeah thats how I did it in short version ofc. \nBut i can tell you guys my life has improved drasticly. I never feel anxiety. I got alot more confident and I do the most logical things just naturally like help other people, study for school stuff like that.\n\nI hope this helped some people if you have anymore questions you can ofc ask them.

Or if they clicked and unclicked, or whatever.\n\nI've made the click 5 days ago, so my experience might be important for you. Realize that the initial excitement will eventually fade but what remains clearly indicates whether you made the click or not.\n\n\nAfter the initial excitement, this is how I feel:\n\n- I feel relieved, with no burden, story or identity\n\n- Bigger awareness, more clear-headed and more connected to others\n\n* I appreciate the beauty of simple things because I realized that I took everything for granted \n\n* More confidence in myself, in way I self-validate myself which allows me to truly listen\n\n* Very hard to identify with individualism\n\n\nI experienced extreme dissonance yesterday in the morning and I had to sit down and understand the reasons:\n\n- Still have remnants of the past, thoughts (beliefs) and habits\n\n- I tried to push them away, forget them, even overslept because of the fear of them being present in the morning\n\n- Before, they made me feel good and now they make me feel extremely bad, afraid and anxious\n\n- The feelings are so present that I can't go on with my day until I figure the reasons why\n\n- I realize now the click is a very important step but there's still a process ahead\n\n\nBasically, I realized that the further someone is from making sense, the more dissonance they will experience after the click. \n\nWhen you go through this experience, you start emotionally framing the world through logic. The neural connections that you've been strengthening your whole life will still be there.\n\nSome of my old habits and beliefs are still rooted in my brain. The difference is that now I subconsciously repel them. What before made me feel good and safe (that was correlated with my previous core value), now brings a lot of anxiety and fear. This is something that I can not control at all.\n\nIt's important to realize that you don't become a super man instantly but you do gain a much bigger awareness and your behavior starts to be subconsciously shaped by your new core value - logic (again, this is not something that you will control, it's just there, just like your old core value was there and you were never afraid of unclicking).\n\nMaking the click is a huge first step but realize that you still have to follow a process to create or strenghten connections in your brain that make more sense. Since you are emotionally driven to use logic to frame your world, you will eventually create a much stronger structure but in the first few days, it's likely that you will experience dissonance from your old rooted habits and beliefs and you will want to seek answers. \n\nReading \"Real Answers\", listening podcasts and reflecting on the causes of my dissonance has been helping me a lot.\n\nAnd remember: just because the initial excitement faded away, it doesn't mean you unclicked. You will probably feel some of the same patterns that I described above. If you don't, be honest with yourself and figure what is still driving you subconsciously.\n\nFor everyone that is trying to click with logic, follow 4 steps:\n\n- Truly understand, trust and love logic. Realize how meaningful logic is. Emotionally connect with it.\n- Identify what core values brought you safety. How did you cope with your fear, insecurities? What do you value the most in life? Be honest, be vulnerable.\n- Compare your current core value with logic and realize how it is actually not contributing to your safety (doing more harm than good) and then realize how logic would bring so much more safety into your life.\n- The further someone is from making sense, the more dissonance they will experience after the click. Be aware of it and always try to frame it logically. \n\nThis is a condensed version, we will improve the process over time.

Ever since the \"Most important video...\" came out, I got tunnel vision. The only thing I cared about for months was trying to find a way to apply the insight to my own life. Whenever I was confronted with a choice due to dissonance, I forced myself to do the most logical thing through discipline. While this allowed me to kick certain bad habits like tobacco and excessive caffeine intake, it was not a happy existence. Although I was feeling healthier, the dissonance never seemed to disappear.\n\nThen the solution came. The insight was conveyed of how to make logic your core value by identifying your old value and realizing it's flawed, destructive nature by comparing it to logic. This process took no more than 10 minutes for me, lying in bed with my eyes closed. The feeling of \"CLICKING\" was very real and tangible. All of a sudden, my awareness had been heightened like crazy. I felt like a blind man who learned how to see for the first time. The feeling of ecstasy, \"dopamine overflow\" was present throughout that evening.\n\nEver since, logic has been there for me everywhere I go. When I before would have done things on an impulse, I now have an automatic logical reasoning whenever confronted with a crossroads or a problem.\n\nHERE'S THE THING THOUGH: I still have dissonance and some anxiety. For example, this wednesday some of my friends were going out to drink alcohol at a local pub. I have basically been drinking alcohol 1-2 times a week for the past four years and even though I thought I had now become a fully rational person, I felt a strong wish to go out with them and get wasted (dissonance). I didn't succumb to the pull, and rationalized the feeling by thinking I must have a slight physical dependence on alcohol. \n\nI thought these kinds of emotional pulls would be gone after \"clicking\".

Outside of school i always escaped reality by gaming on the pc. When i enterd to the Gymnasium i had a real hard time deciding what i should be doing with my life so i just chosed what fit my persona the best. I chose to educate myself to a carpentner because i did not want to sit and not move my body anymore since my body told me i did not feel good about it.\nAfter school i started working as a carpenter right away Since i was told i had to work in life and earn money. Even now i did not know what i wanted to do with my life. But it was around 1 year after i started working that i was kinda forced into training my body at the gym since my body was in bad shape after all this sitting and gaming. Through all of my school time i have had problems with stomach pain and cramps in my muscles and now i forced my self to start training to get rid of this problem. I now started training alot outside of work and started to feel better in my body. \nI had now lost my work as a carpentner and decided to follow my newfound passion for training and health to educate my self to a personal trainer and grow into a stronger version of my self. After my education i found a work as personal trainer pretty fast and decided that i now wanted to learn as much as possible about training etc. I wanted to read and learn alot but i never did... i just procrastinated and never really felt like reading up and learning stuff even if i wanted it! And as result i have been on and off depressed for a year until about 1 month ago. I had now found Athenes stream and found it really intresting! I started listening to his podcast almost every day and tried to catch time to visit the stream. As a result i patched up my life some and realised why i was doing what i was.\n\nSo this tuesday i watched Athenes stream and got really excited with how many ppl it was that actually clicked. \nAfter the stream i went to bed and woke up next day (yesterday, wednesday) and started meditation on my life. And it is so clear to me that my subconsius core value is comfort since it knows it does not have to do anything in order to live on so to say, i dont really know how to explain it better. \n\nAbout now i knew that my core value is comfort and decided to change it since comfort only bring me depression by not being able to do what i really want. I looked at what i was doing and what i had to do in order for it to be logical and realised that it was not logical at all to be working as a personal trainer and grow into a stronger version of my self, because its my ego that want all this.\nI really had a hard time letting go of this at first and i really had to talk with my inner child and say it was okay and make it feel good about logic and that logic is something warm and beutiful. So i accepted that it was much more logical to apply to Athene and work with changing the world than my ego growing as a personal trainer, i realise that working as a personal trainer brings very little to the world.\nWhen i actually took this leap of fait i really got a fuzzy feeling in my stomach/chest and got really excited when i realiced what i had done. After this i also got really stressed out, anxious and restless and i still got this feeling. It is acctually hard to breath something tight in my chest and have now felt this for 1and a half day. I have a hard time really knowing what it is that is causing it but i think its because i dont really work on something that with a good cause yet, like spreading this knowledge....\nI really feel like making logic out of everything though, i have been super aware all this time trying to make logic of what i do!\nI will now apply to athene and as soon as i know that i have been accepted i will quit my work asap and travel to Athenes place pronto!","createdAt":1476956528,"score":5,"author":"dokza","id":"58fzkc"},{"title":"I almost clicked yesterday?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/58fsna/i_almost_clicked_yesterday/","selftext":"I first tried to click the day before yestetday, after the stream at night. I went really deep and figured out my core value. On a rational level I realised that if I replace it with logic it will be better for me and my environment, but I couldn't do it on an emotional level so I obviously didn't click.\n\nYesterday I tried it again at first in the morning. I really tried hard to get it on my emotion, like repeating myself \"logic, logic\", \" I trurly want logic\", \"I know it's bettet than comfort\" etc, almost like I was talking to God or sth (I'm not religious person at all). It also didn't work.\n\nBut I tried it again at night, after Athene's stream. Again, tried to go really deep and I did. But I could not  feel any emotions. I felt I'm dead inside and laid down to fall asleep. While I was trying to fall asleep I started imagining how my life would change if I switched my core value to logic. I started imagining what decisions would I make, how I would go about certain problems. And I felt hyped. I thought like damn I feel some emotions, maybe this is the time! So I did the same thing as in the morning and the day before that but no results again. I was expecting that amazing feeling in my stomach, chest and body overall wchich people described but it didn't come. I almost wanted to give up, I thought like maybe on a core emotional level I feel safe and comfortable with my current core value and I just don't want to change it. But my rational me wanted to change it and I thought I was never so close to the \"click\" before so I didn't give up. This time I tried to debunk my beliefs one after another and I sudenly felt that! Strange feeling around my stomach at first, and then wonderful warm feeling in my hands. When I realised it I could also make that warm feeling in every part of my body. I didn't knkw what is going on. This was beautiful but I wasn't sure if that was the best feeling ever. I thought at that time that I felt better after smoking weed or after falling in love. It was very close to those feelings but it wasn't the best in my life. So I questioned if that's it and if I made the click or not. I asked myself questions about what will I do about this, what will I do about that, questions like \"Do I feel like spreading it\", \"Do I think this is gonna revolutionize the world\" etc. \"I don't know\" was my answer to everything. Although my rational part of the brain told me logical answers, I could also feel my emonal old comfott value me, bringing up the old answers and old habits.  But I couldn't choose either option (or answer). At that point I could trurly only \"not know\". I could still feel that great feeling but I was afraid a little bit why \" I don't know\" shit. I felt like Jon Snow for real. So I texted my older brother and explained hm that. He said that I might have \"leap of faith\". So I thought \" Ye, probably\" and tried to find the answers again and accept logic on a new core value. But I couldn't and \"I don't know\" was still my answer for everything. I thought I should go to sleep and see what will happen. So I did. And I woke up today and nothing changed.\n\n(Edit: Something might changed. I feel kinda sharper but I think that's it. Will edit and add more stuff if I find out sth new)\n\nCould some1 explain me what happened?

I have always tried to make my decisions based on the most logical way, everything from major life choices to smaller things like if I should clean the house or what not. Athene’s real talk made me stronger in this logical way of perceiving reality, although I never could really grasp many of the topics he used to talk about like advanced neuroscientific fundamentals and such, I always ended the stream feeling more closer to reality in a seemingly logical way.\n\n\nThe actual story:\n\nSo I was watching the stream on the 19th of October, and this was the first time I ever heard Athene speak about the click and having logic as a core value. After closing the stream I went to bed and I had major dissonance. I reevaluated my whole life and what I’m actually doing right now. I woke up and I felt like a paradigm shift had happened in my sleep. I felt happy about going to school for once, and in school I felt like I was on adderal. I felt really clear and I absolutely loved learning about biological ecosystems, redox reactions and what not, because it was all so logical and beautiful. This coming from a 17 year old slacker that previously saved all his studies for the night before the test and never really payed attention in class. \n\nThe whole day felt so euphoric, I told my girlfriend about the whole click deal and the fundamentals about it, she was rather skeptical but she loved the fact that I seemed to have control over my life and my studies. I later sat on the bus on my way home and just observed every single building and object that passed by, and I saw them and went level by level deeper in what the object really was made up of, I suppose like the video Athene showed the stream the 19th, where everything was built up of mathematical calculations and logic. For every single image that entered my thought process, the roots of the image was always logic. Everything in my surrounding was pure logic and I felt so clear and happy for some reason. I glanced at my girlfriend that was sitting next to me, and I just looked at her for a very long time and appreciated how beautiful she is and how much I love her. I’ve always loved her immensely but this feeling I got in the bus, this feeling I could not properly describe for a million dollars. Aaand this is the reason behind why I don’t think I’ve fully made the click. I simply can’t see myself having logic as a core value and at the same time have my life so dependent on love.\n\nI feel rather lost, I don’t know if it’s my poor understanding of how the brain handles love as an emotion, but I can’t portray my affection for my girlfriend with logic. My train of thought spiraled like crazy after the bus trip. I thought of different scenarios that could happen, for example me getting a chance to stay at Athenes and help them do their work. I know for a fact that going there would be the most logical thing that I could do. BUT, I do not think that I could let my girlfriend go just like that. So basically I feel like I understand, love and feel warmth for logic, but at the same time I feel insane dissonance because I'm in a way contradicting myself when it comes to having to chose between something logical vs my girlfriend. Therefore I believe that my core value is love, but at the same time I know that logic drives me and that I love logic in a way that Athene himself describes his love for it. You might say that there’s logic behind me having these feelings for my girlfriend, and yes, I fully understand that. The problem is that I know that I could/would make illogical decisions when love enters the picture.\n\nCould the problem be that I find comfort in my love towards my girlfriend? I am so lost lol\n\nI know this whole click thing is new, and I know that my story might sound stupid but I was hoping for some advice.

This led me to constantly seek for a routine in my daily life that provided me safety-comfort (my core value). For me, the life I thought that was the best I could ever live, was: eating-&gt;playing videogames in my early teenage years and then in my adult life eating -&gt;working out-&gt; playing videogames-&gt;online friends\n\nAs obvious as it appears to be, that is a completely messed up lifestyle-behavior and even my dysfunctional mother could see it and point it out to me. When she did so, she would do it screaming at the top of her lungs criticizing that all I do everyday is wake up and play videogames, and this created a lot of dissonance in my mind (like I mentioned before, I didn't even know dissonance was a word or that I was experiencing what it means)... this would lead to a big argument with my mother, a \"fight\" if you will, and once I had exhausted all my stupid silly arguments I would \" Click \".\n\nI would Click by completely removing my emotions and stop trying to look for comfort, I would instead focus on how to improve my life in a logical way, weighting and measuring my odds instinctively     , without thinking. I just was. But I didn't know I was, I didn't know what logic was/is , I didn't even know that I had this duality in me, that one part of the brain could completely suppress the other or even be in a constant fight with each other. This moment of clarity, this \"click\", would only last 24h-72h, it was genuine, I see it now without a pinch of doubt.... until I experienced dissonance... until I experienced dissonance in my search for \"improvement\". As soon as I experienced dissonance I would look for comfort right there and then. I would \"unclick\". I would lie to my mother, would sell drugs,  I would sell my friends for money... anything to be back in my bubble of comfort and validation.\n\nI'm aware now, I see it what it means to have logic as your core value but I have no insight other than to learn from what I've experienced in my life that I can now reflect upon. I have a lot to learn and I see everything completely differently now.  If it wasn't for Athene's own insights I would have continued in my vicious cycle of stupid misguided wasted life that I had no control over even though I could swear with my hand on any holy book without blinking, that I was indeed in complete control of my life. I would lie and believe my own lie without even realizing it. Fucked up.\n\nI haven't mentioned I have managed to remove my social anxiety overnight (which I've also had FOR YEARS WITHOUT ME REALIZING IT).

I don't like greed at all, so I like staying at a certain comfort level.\nI don't desire a car, let alone a BMW or a mansion with swimming pool. However, I like my PC, a good movie, warmth, food and a small backyard.\n\nThe past week or 2, I have been listening to all the real talk podcast episodes.\nI have also watched your many relevant YouTube and Twitch videos.\nWhat I did at some point was put a note that says \"Do you make sense\" on my dresser.\nMore and more I kept posing myself that question whenever I would think of doing anything.\nAs a result I'm being more logical and feel that I am making much better judgment calls.\nMy diet has improved, and I am getting in better shape fast. So without a doubt I think logic is an amazing tool. It makes sense for sure.\n\nI am watching a recent stream of yours, and people are saying they are giving up their videogames for example. But is that a good call? I do get that playing a game seems nonsensical. But a game can be a positive experience that adds to your life. I myself have learned a thing or 2 about life through playing videogames. So it seems extreme to drop gaming altogether. Or does one not need to do that? Where I am right now, I would say, don't play too much. But you don't have to give up gaming altogether.\n\nHere is another example from my life. I really like drinking red wine. I like the taste, smell, color of it. Even feeling a slight buzz feels good to me. I don't really care too much about other alcoholic drinks. But red wine is sort of a passion to me. Logic as a core value would dictate that I should not drink alcohol full stop. But as long as I am not binge drinking, I would say it adds to my life and happiness in a positive way, because I really enjoy having a glass of wine.\n\nSo which logic do follow? The logic that says right out of the gate that I should not play a videogame and have any alcohol?

Why is this relevant? I find myself inexplicably stuck on finding my core value, figuring out why I feel certain things (sometimes even hours after some experiences) and I hope that narrowing down why will help me finally find a way to solve this puzzle and help me let go (whatever it is I'm holding on to).\n\nWhen I was 17, I constantly kept looking for simple patterns in organisms and life on earth on a timeline with the question why? Why does life behave this way? And why is life \"alive\" (on a deeper level, not in accordance to the definition of \"alive\" which is just a superficial understanding)? I know that sounds stupid, but it were things I felt I had to understand to be able to progress on this planet in a meaningful way. And eventually, a thought crossed my mind: \"what if alien organisms are built completely different than us and as such experience this completely different\" and a lot of other, stranger \"what if\" questions crossed my mind. So I realized that all my conclusions were only somewhat valid as a human being. More so, they'd only be valuable to me as I can't provide any proof for my thoughts, as others would rightfully consider them speculations and nothing more. For me, these thoughs becames ideas I believe. A solid puzzle piece I could build on and fit other pieces in as I learn things or fit it into a bigger concept. This was late at night, I actually have some of this stuff written down as I felt it was important enough to come out of bed for and start writing.\n\nTo the point: at the culmination of my thinking process, I experienced a strange feeling. It's a bit like you describe the feelings you get from a click. What I remember most from the feeling was that everything made sense, and it was so beautiful. I was connected with everything, everything was connected to each other. I felt like I was at the center of the universe and could see everything. Like something you imagine in your head but more clearly, without actually seeing it. These weird and abstract concepts which usually make me feel friction in my head (best way I can describe it), like infinity, were concrete and simple. \nIt's also important to note that the culmination, my conclusion was that all life just grows (in the sense of extending it's lifespan but not on an individual level, but all life together as a group which is why lifeforms that damage others will eventually be eliminated. Not consciously, but because it just happens). Not necessarily because it wants to, it just does. Or at least, that's what I could spot in the patterns on our timeline. Please don't take my words too literal there. It goes much deeper than that and it's more complex but I can not explain it. And like I said, I don't have proof. These are just my beliefs, my puzzle piece I can fit into other pieces even or strip down the parts that have been 100% proven wrong or don't need anymore. That made me change my behaviour, I became a lot more open. I had less trouble doing this I originally disliked doing. I didn't feel good when I had nothing to do with myself. That was when things got downhill. I started looking at the world through the news, filtering the perception of the journalists and their ideologies, I felt increasingly detached to society.\nI did not feel like I was a part of it anymore and right now I constantly shift between not wanting to be apart of it at all and being very involved in it, improving it. I went into a depression where I couldn't go to school anymore for a long time. At the point where I had to choose between going back to school or dropping out, I chose to go to school anyways and just lock everything up. I struggled through all of it but as my \"symptoms\" started getting worse and worse, I couldn't even make it one month into university. It was a shame because the content wasn't a problem.\n\nFast forward today. I still feel torn by this contradiction of not wanting to be a part of society and wanting to help lots. It goes a bit deeper than that. I do have a diagnosis for Asperger's syndrome, I'm not convinced this is accurate but it's plausible as I do seem to have a lot of issues that fall under that \"label\". There are a few examples. When I'm around a lot of people (even family), I get stressed so easily.  Everything is way too overwhelming, the noise of people talking, their postures, their tone of voice, the content of their words, the expressions on their faces, their scents, everything. In the beginning this was in combination with low self esteem and this made me completely useless. Now, I realize impressions don't matter. I'm not worried about my ego in this sense (though it might turn out I do worry about it in other aspects, I just can't figure it out).\nAnd it all just pales in comparison to the importance of the bigger things I'm concerned about, which is pretty much finding a way to make the biggest positive impact I can make on the world. \nIn some cases I'm actually happy to socialize despite all these overwhelming factors, I try and put a positive spin to everything and every negative vibe I get I assign to \"me not being involved\". But then afterwards when I come home, I get painfully hyper, agressive, irrational followed by exhaustion and sadness. And that I have a hard time understanding. Is it my subsconscious that has picked up on stuff I surpressed and then needs to be released all at once? And how to I get rid of this? Do I just need to be tranquilized whenever I have to be among people cause my brain just absorbs all this (mostly) useless info? \nI've been to psychiatrists (4) and psychologists (2) ever since my experience (17), and 2 psychiatrists before that experience to address my attention deficit disorder (which I feel is misdiagnosed a bit, I get tired quickly from reading and hearing but that's probably just because I'm picking up all that information from every little muscle on people's faces and so on, resulting in me getting a huge mix of feelings and \"vibes\" from people to the point it just becomes super distracting in class). I'm 24 now and I feel like I've been able to analyze myself pretty well now, better than the professional help has which the latest psychologist I visited has noticed as well. It makes me a hard patient to treat, mostly because there is no cure for what I experience. This is why I hope your view on logic can help me. Honestly though, I'm skeptical. What if some people, people who are neurologically different. People who's brains are largely a mystery to scientists today, are unable to experience what you experience? I'd be a bit sad if it's impossible for me to make the click. Though at the other hand, who knows? Maybe some people need to \"stay in the dark\". Maybe I'll see and discover things here you guys \"in the light\" can't. Maybe it'll be like how people look at garbage men today: undervalued, yet invaluable.\n\nI see a lot of similarities between my thought from back then and your view on logic. I've got to say that I don't watch the stream every day, and sometimes I leave months in between watching. I've not followed any realtalk yet, I will eventually. Would it even help someone like me?\n\nImportant note:\nI'm not comfortable now and I feel like I need some comfort to be able to function. I can't make the biggest compact I could make when I have all these impulses wearing me out. That makes sense, right?\nI haven't been comfortable gaming, studying, ANYTHING. Only my girlfriend can ease my stress, but even then I can't help but feel I'm failing her. I constantly feel guilty, like I'm wasted potential, wasting resources, wasting humanity.\n\nOn the topic of my girlfriend: I feel like anyone can connect to anyone. But I have this idea that you can connect to someone so profoundly that you essentially become one. That's what I'm achieving with her, it's very crazy. I honestly believe one day everyone can connect to everyone like I do with her, and maybe your belief around logic is a necessary step. When I ask myself why we're in a relationship, my answer would be because we are stronger together. We can make a bigger impact, grow and learn from each other, correct each other when either one of us has a lapse of concentration and we complement each other too (I said we're becoming one, but it's larger than being the same so we're still different, but also one.. I hope you understand what I mean).\n\nVery long text, I know, I'm sorry. I hope I wrote it in an easy-going manner. Thanks if you made it all the way through, appreciate it :)\n\nI kind of feel bad cause I haven't been on this subreddit before, just came here today and haven't taken any time in reading through anyone's post here. I'll read some now!\n\nEdit: And if I didn't click, what did I experience and why does it feel so similar? If I did click, then why am I so hopefully lost? Why don't I feel like I want to come over to Germany and join you guys (it's not like I don't want to) I've got to say that I believe feelings can be useful. I'm well aware they can fool you. But if I'm correct most of my feelings are a result of my subconscious picking up patterns and relaying it to my conscious brain almost immediately and very strongly. I would agree they are definitely in the way since I have no control, but they're not 100% irrational which is contradicting as per the definition, but hey it wouldn't be the first time definitions haven't been sufficiently detailing a word/concept. I just don't know to be honest. It was so clear years ago. It's hard to believe, I felt like a cloud had lifted. And I still feel that way, I just feel extreme discomfort, disbelief (with the world, society) as well. Important to note that I don't look down on society or people, I just don't know how I can help anymore. I feel like that would destroy me as being around people becomes too much so quickly.","createdAt":1476910855,"score":2,"author":"LTNewHate","id":"58cs9n"},{"title":"Trying to \"click\" in High School","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/58bv8v/trying_to_click_in_high_school/","selftext":"Hello I am 15 years old in the United States and have been following Athene for about 3 years.

At school I wasn't really part of any social circle, and was mildly bullied. As a result my self esteem became pretty low. At age 14 this had a consequence. I deciced I was going to prove to myself that I'm better than everybody else. I started focussing a lot on my school work and got into the best university. At university, I followed two specializations while you were only required to follow one. After university I took a job in the games industry, which I idolized as one of the hardest (and interesting) places to be in. And now I am an one man studio, working towards creating games all by myself. My comfort bubble became close to perfect. I had enough money, friends, success, and work I enjoyed.\n\n\n**How I was able to make the click**\n\nObserving that with the latest insights people started clicking, clicking no longer seemed unachievable. I didn't experience disonance however, and I didn't know what my core value was. So getting things started was pretty hard and took a while.\n\nThe main advice that took me to the gold was to seek up the disonance. I knew that spending my effort on my work instead of saving childrens lives isn't logical. So that's where I started pushing. I would push until I felt disonance about it. Because I knew I should be feeling disonance about it. After 2 days of intermitted meditating I succeeded. I was now emotionally invested. From there things went rather quick. I realized I was emotionally attached to my work. Questioned why that was, and traced it back all the way to my childhood. I compared my actions against the actions that would be logical. From that mindset I was able to percieve logic as a warm good thing, and my brain took the jump. I felt my body take a gasp of air. My eyes widened. My heart started pounding. The world no longer seemed the same. The following 10 minutes I was walking circles through my living room thinking of all the implications while profoundly feeling excitement. Started deciding on actions. And am now writing this post for others to learn from.\n\nIt is only a hour post click. Still excited, though the excitement will probably wear off.

As if rational thinking is some kind of \"OP-mechanism\" I've developed into my thinking and mindset, like a cheat code for life.\nAnd this goes to every little action in life, what I eat, drink and other tiny but very important things physically when it comes to being disabled. I used to feel like I had to do annoying 'chores' for my body that nobody else (except other paraplegics) had to do. Today it's just automatic. It's not even close to being annoying and ruining my day like it used to. It used to be so easy to be in a bad mood and depressed.\n\nBad foods and drinks are completely a turn-off, automatically. It's just -ev to ruin my body and my energy. However, this has less to do with my core value, this is just something that came within this supposed click. I want to self-improve and use this as my tool for having energy physically and being strong mentally. \nThis 'click' rapidly changed my whole life and how I look at things. It's really an unbelivable \"eye-opening\" feeling. Part of this cured my depression. I feel like my negative inner dialogue and ego has vanished. To me, my prior self-development really has supported this thing at it's whole. \n\nAs a paraplegic I know what it's like to literally go through hell in a hospital for 4 months. It's so easy to lose hope and be suicidal once you get out of the hospital and have to re-evaluate your whole life and yet still feel hopeless. It's not only that they don't have legs, and have to wheel around in wheelchair. There's so much more internal things, not only responsability and respect for your body, but symptoms that make them feel worthless and like they are just in the way of society. I've heard it from so many other disabled people.\nConstant neuropathic pains being the worst enemy for paraplegics, having this very tough pain every day of life, making most of them stay in bed for 16h~ of day.\n I used to be that guy many many months ago, waaay before the click too, however, I overcome all of this hopelessness and problems with personal development, meditation, and healthy foods (rich with anti-inflammatory properties). Months and months of reading  and learning. My mindset is completely different from what it was a year ago. It's incomparable. I'm not suffering any more, but millions of other paraplegics are.\n\nI feel like the click was almost like an 'understanding-orgasm' in some way. It was 'aha'-moments after aha-moments and then I re-evaluated everything in the middle of the night and I realize I haven't been making sense, I had always adapted comfort as my core value. I used to have this mindset that \"Oh I am one of the very ill people in this world, I shouldn't have to do much more than just life from now on.\" and it was just self destructive in the long run, physically aswell. \n\nAbout a month ago, before I had even the supposed click I signed a long-term Poker coaching contract, it's a program that can take up to year to finish and I'm on the first stepping stone. I have talent and I wanna use this talent in a way that I can raise awareness and money for Spinal cord injuries. I know why and what kind of twitch-poker streams bring the most exposure. \nIt's not that I want hundreds of people to watch me playing big tournaments and feel sorry for me (I don't wanna seek any kind of validation, it isn't helping), and because of my situation donate to spinal-cord injury awareness charities because they feel like I'm some kind of a 'hero' because I can't feel or move anything from my waist down. It doesn't matter how people look at my situation, my paraplegia doesn't matter anymore since I'm not suffering from it. If I woke up and could run thousand miles, I'd still still wanna cure paraplegia. I think of people who currently are suffering and it gives me some kind of drive to just say 'fuck it' and go for not only this vision, but anything that could help whether it's short term or long term. It's just a very special genuine feeling I have never felt before in my life. I don't care if people look up to me or not because of this change in my life, I don't need any validation to keep me going.\n\nI want to raise awareness and money so we can together fight this and help millions of people suffering from paraplegia.\nI want to bring out the best of me in every aspect when raising money and awareness for Spinal Cord injury.\n\nIt's a big picture and a long term thing, but I think this is the best I can do in my situation. I myself have lived through the early stages of having a spinal cord injury, and I know what it feels like to be hopeless and have these thoughts in the head \"will I ever walk again? will I ever have sex again? will I ever have kids?\" etc. -- and I wanna completely eliminate this worry these people are having and give them hope, both in the future and For the future. \nIt's a big vision, curing spinal cord injury, but it's achievable in this lifetime if people are engaged and aware. I remember a few years ago when Gaming for good started, we have raised so much money for the kids, it's insane. And it's through twitch entertainment, everything for saving the kids. I feel like the most optimal way to raise awareness and money for Spinal-cord injury is like this in MY specific situation.\nI can barely leave my house, I need nurses checking on me everyday, I need a bunch special medical equipment etc, and I can't think of any better idea than using my talent. It's a journey and I know I will come up of more ways I can help out even better.\n\nSince this supposed \"click\" I feel like the anxiety I used to have is just gone. I used to be nervous and have a bit of social anxiety when it comes to the bigger picture, which lead to me being less effective. I'm no longer nervous and anxious in the coaching sessions. I used to be afraid to say things wrong, or fuck up in other ways only because the ridiculous thoughts in my head (like: I'm getting coached by literally the best player in the world, I don't wanna waste his time or make it awkward, even if I paid good money for it)\n\nIt just doesn't make any sense any longer to do -ev things. It's just so automatically \"unattractive\". It makes so much more sense to help humanity evolve, there is no reason to be here otherwise except for experiencing life, but that's not my priority. \nThere is no cure for spinal-cord injury, the scientific-research and development budget when it comes to this is waaay to small. Stem-cell research just RECENTLY became sort of a big hit when it comes to Spinal cord injury. It has so much potential, but so much money is funded on different things in this world...\n\nI feel like my mind is calibrating pretty rapidly to do everything in +ev automatically and it's like I'm piecing a puzzle together and getting more sharp. I'm learning everyday what can I do to put more hours into studying the game, grinding and in general be more effective/productive. Meditation and listening to my body being the key.\n\nIt's this feeling that I kind of 'feel sorry' for people missing out, but it's just the way their situation is at the moment, and it's gonna be a really hard transition for some, especially because many of them aren't understanding and realizing their own potential. Everyone that seems to be \"hopeless\" in chat actually do have potential, it's just so \"hidden\" to them (was for me). I think it's where it started to me.\n\nEven IF it is that I'm just being completely delusional of this vision, I still wanna put this out and hope it catches on to someone else that already has exposure and a following (whether it's the twitch platform or not), I hope someone out there takes this and starts raising awareness and money for charity.\n\nI'm not gonna be disappointed or emotional if I haven't clicked yet, I wanna work on it and get there. There is so much I don't know and haven't learned yet. I will learn from errors and mistakes. Since I've came this far and so much has happened in so little time. I still need to learn more about validation-seeking, this being one of my flaws. Experiencing dissonance has been key to me.\n\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1476842217,"score":5,"author":"fffmatura","id":"587u65"},{"title":"Using what you have or starting over?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/586opa/using_what_you_have_or_starting_over/","selftext":"So ı have been thinking a lot and watching the streams lately i heard stories of how people suddenly changed stopped gaming, alcohol...

You could say I was in a small boat in the ocean floating without any possibility the navigate. Where ever the wind was blowing I was going. That was a scary conclusion I made about my life very recently. \n\nBut with Realtalk things changed. It provided a logical view on things and through it I was able to answer a lot of questions I had. Suddenly the world became a more predictable place. It lost a lot of its scary part. Things that seemed totally random became explainable. The actions of others made more sense to me because I was able to recognize patterns. It is like the world reviled itself. It took me some time but eventually I was able to transfer the insights I gained through Realtalk onto my own life. Therefore, I found reasons for things I did that seemed very random and unconscious to me. I made me able to become a more self-determined person. You could almost say I developed from a puppet that was controlled by its environment and random circumstances to a person that takes his life into his own hands. I eventually took responsibility and that meant no more blaming others. While this can seem very scary I came to the conclusion that taking my life into my own hands is the only way to life a fulfilled life. \nThrough Realtalk I understood that logic was the very key to solve all my problems. So from then on I applied logic on a regular basis to cope with my problems. And indeed I could solve all the problems I came across. It was a big turning point in my life. From a life with a lot of dissonance and the feeling of emptiness it changed to a very comfortable and easy going one. There was almost no dissonance at all anymore. \n\nThe reason why I didn’t feel this emptiness anymore was that through Realtalk I got convinced, for the first time in my life, that life actually has a purpose. And it wasn’t in a floaty way like you usually get when you are looking for purpose. It seemed very reasonable, universal and easy to agree upon. And this was to move forward in the most effective way and that as a whole, not as an isolated single unit. It was the very moment when I adopted this definition of purpose as my new core value and I started to work towards it. \nSo I was feeling very comfortable with myself and I finally found purpose in my life. There was no reason for me to change my current mindset right?\n\nWrong. In fact, I was drastically wrong with this attitude and I tell you why that is. I settled with this just because it fulfilled my needs good enough to have a decent life. But what I didn’t notice even though I applied logic in many situations of my life me as a whole didn’t make full sense yet. I didn’t understand that in order to even define a reasonable way of purpose you need logic. You have many people that think they found purpose in life and are very happy with it. But often this results in them killing themselves and others for a “greater good” or sitting in a temple and exploring their minds for years and decades. That was far from my definition of purpose. But you may ask how was I even able to develop this idea of purpose without me being fully logic? Well, I was lucky enough to know someone how defined for me what purpose is. I didn’t have to do it myself. I just had to agree upon it. But this person was only able to make this conclusion of purpose through logic. So if this person didn’t exist I wouldn’t even be able to develop this idea of purpose as a core value of mine. I would still feel this emptiness. So I wasn’t so self-determined after all! I was just able to recognize if someone provided a logical view on things. But it didn’t come out of myself. That was very likely because I build something on logic and only fall back on logic when things stopped working or gaps opened up. So I knew that logic provides all of the answer and solves all my problems. It just doesn’t make sense to value something over logic and only fall back on logic when things stop working out. Why not stick to it in the first place? That I still can’t truly answer to myself. Maybe because it was a short cut for me? I just took the first conclusion that made me feel good so I didn’t have to think everything through?\n\nSomeone else had to point out again that my core value of purpose doesn’t really make sense if I need logic to define it anyway and most likely through valuing something above logic I diminish the very impact I want to have. He explained that purpose is a side effect. It works similar as happiness. Happiness is a side effect out of a purposeful life. There are studies that show that chasing happiness actually results in a less happy life. I knew that, so I could easily relate that it works the same for purpose. Purpose is a side effect out of logic. Take logic away and you don’t have purpose anymore or at least a flawed idea of purpose. No purpose no happiness. So chasing purpose and valuing it over logic will most likely result in less impact and less fulfilled life. \nAt this point I felt sick that I always needed other people to provide logic in my life and point out the flaws in my thinking. I finally want to be able to draw these conclusions myself. I want to become a self-determined person at last. What if that other person who provided logic in my life has a flaw in his thinking as well? How would I even be able to notice that? I would hunt a flawed concept someone else built my whole life. So I finally needed to go full logic!\n\nAnd to draw the bridge to the title again. I settled with a satisfying option just because I was feeling good enough and didn’t went for the whole deal. That slowed down my personal development harmed the very thing I think I wanted to have and at its worst might have cost a lot of lives for me slacking around. \nHopefully some people might find similarities in their lives and this helps them to “click” easier…\n","createdAt":1476813820,"score":2,"author":"Xintha","id":"585ajb"},{"title":"I also made the click","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Makingsense/comments/57y74j/i_also_made_the_click/","selftext":"I've been thinking about this logic as a core value for about 4 days straight now, non-stop ive been trying to make it my core value and i think I've finally done and the feeling is amazing.\nThe way i did it was by doing pretty much what athene said. However, it took me a lot longer to actually do\n\n1) I was really honest to my self about my core value and why i had it, and really going deep into my childhood to see the reasons i had that core value. If there are any important moments in your life that  you think shaped you, ask why they did and in what way. Another good way is by thinking what you do through out your day and why.\n\n2) Compare the core value of logic to the one you have, why one would be better than the other. At this point you should experience dissonance because you are going against your Core but that is good. after this you can also compare it with something that happened in your life (e.g getting dumped) and if you would feel better with logic which you would.\n\n3) After this i just repeated these steps constantly in combat with my core value and why logic would be better. There wasn't  any concrete thing that made me click. However , it helped me to watch cosmos ep 13 like Ricardo said . That might work for some not for others,\n\n\n\n\nWhen you do manage to actually make logic/making sense your core value(make sure you don't lie to yourself about having it as a core value) you will experience  a great amount pleasure as there's a release of dopamine then you will feel a really warm feeling in your chest(that is how it felt for me). \nYou might also question if you really did adopt logic, You will not want that feeling to go away and it shouldn't ,you will want to spread it.\n\n\nI hope this helps people. It might take some time but trust just keep going, figure out and question your core even  if it doesn't work the first time just keep going. When i  was questioning my core and trying to replace it i was doing it pretty much everywhere. When taking a shower, while walking to school, in School, at home, when trying to sleep.

I believe this is not because they are lazy or stuck in comfort but because our neurons constantly shift (bear with me, neuroscience beginner) and we experience different states throughout the day. So one might have very good reasoning and intentions for behavioral change but throughout the day these shifts would push them back into old patterns.\n\nA thing that I've noticed that helps a lot is to write about your thoughts when you have moments of clarity and read them later to bring more of a long-term line in your life. Writing also helps you remember better.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Actively try to get rid of your sense of identity and ego throughout the day. Meditate on it in the mornings and try to make it a habit to see everyone and everything as part of you.\n\n- Remember that you're still a slave to your senses. Try to see people as bits of consciousness and actively try to avoid judging them based on how they look or sound. \n\nI have quite a few of these and they change throughout time as I solve problems and others arise, but I think the main idea is clear. You write as to make your thoughts more tangible.

At the time I didn't know what was happening to me, why I sudenly felt so great and had so much energy. Now that I realise what happened it is easier for me to explain it and spread this awarenes. \n\nI made the click in late August when I had a lot of free time. For me it wasn't an instant click but rather a consequense of acting logical and responsible. I listened a lot to real talk, meditated, worked out, ate healthy and read about human biology. It became a routine that replaced my old core value of comfort to logic or making sense.\n\nIn this post I want to discuss how I experienced this switch and relate it to the phases that Athene discribed. This is going to be a long post. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to leave a comment or message me.\n\n\n&gt; You have an eye-opening catharsis.\n\nThe thing that made me change my belief-system was the concept of being selfless. When you realise you are part of a bigger organism and everything is part of you and that the self, as in identity, doesn't exist your start a-lining you actions in to what makes sense. You experience a drive to learn what you are and want to help others.\n\n\n\n&gt;You experience a dopamine overflow. \n\nYES. When i made the switch a felt indescribably good. My reward system was always active, I had so much energy that I couldn't sleep. It went on for more then a week, I didn't know what was happening to me. It felt unreal. It felt like al my problems where gone. The best way I can discribe it is the \"iner fire\" feeling you had when you where young and feel like you can do anything.\nThe only fear I experienced was losing this amazing feeling. \n\n&gt;You have a drastic altered state of awernes and start to think different. \n\nAnd\n\n&gt; You start to think more logical and want to understand everything.\n\nAfter I made the switch a was in a constant meditative state. My awarenes icreased a lot. I experienced the urge to learn about what we are, the paterns of evolution and started learning about the universe. I didn't experience any dissonance, only mental clearity. When I experience a negative emotion I don't identify with it. \n\n&gt; You have a fear of losing the feeling.\n\nI was afraid to lose this amazing feeling. Unfortunately I had a temporary setback when college started again. It got harder to make sense when your inviroment doesn't always. I also learned that there is a strong mind-body relationship to keep momentum going. When I experienced some stress in combination with feeling ill my old habits and core value of comfort started to take over. When this happened I lost the feeling of \"dopamine overflow\". In my experience it gets harder to take distance from your emotions when you are feeling sick or less aware.\n\nAfter yesterdays stream I realised what happened to me and it made me able to switch back to logic as my core value. I didn't take long to switch back and I immediately got the rewarding feeling back.\n\n&gt; You want to spread it\n\nWhen it first happened to me, I wanted to spread it but didn't really understood what happened to me. I felt like contributing to the world and became volonteer of a helping-organisation. Now that I have the knowledge it's easier to explain this to other people. \n\n&gt; Your confindence goes up\n\nNever in my life before I felt so truly confident. I feel like self-confidence isn't relevant anymore because I just am and act logical. \n\nI hope this post helped and can inspire you to make \"the leap of faith\".

Since the latter is something that many people would frown upon, I think that my process/progress and the insights that guided me can be helpful for other people that are still in doubt, it can be used as an example to show that adopting the values of the realtalk will lead to an application.\n\n**Making sense**\n\nThe first major experience I had with Making sense was Athene's main video about it. Before this, as a result of studying physics for four years, I was already well aware that the natural world around us indeed makes a lot of sense: everything can be written in equations that describe the logical patterns that govern nature. This gave me comfort since everytime I came across a problem about nature, I *knew* it could be solved and there was a logical explanation. \n\nWatching the video was an eye-opening experience in the sense that for the first time I realized that not only the physical world makes sense, but also, as *part of* this world, we as humans. All the imperfections about the world, all the irrational behaviour of people *do make sense*. At this point I got goosebumps and something really changed, I knew that I could now extrapolate the trust I had in the logic of nature to *everything* that comes across my path.\n\nKnowing this I went about life, trying to make sense of everything that came across my path, including human interactions, which became much more interesting and learnful. My life became so more rich and I learned from everything by trying to make sense of it.\n\n\n**Critical thinking**\n\nWith the focus of the Realtalk shifting to *critial thinking* I came across a second eye-opening conclusion. Up until now, I tried to make sense of everything that crossed my path. This means everything that was *new* in my life. However, by critical thinking I realized that I should also try to make sense of what I do and *have been doing*, i.e. studying physics. So, I sat down and started:\n\n*Why do I study physics, now?*\n\nBecause I want to become a teacher in the last two years of highschool.\n\n*Why do I want to become a teacher in highschool?*\n\nBecause I want to spread the scientific thinking (i.e. logical thinking) across society in the most efficient way. Since this way of thinking is most in line with reality (by definition almost?).\n\n*Is teaching in highschool the most effective way to spread this paradigm?*\n\nWell,...no. Let's be honost, eventhough these people are at a point where they have the time to think about this stuff and where they have to decide what to do after highschool, as a teached you only see about 75 different students each year. Moreover, my colleagues would probably not be very stimulating either. *SO*, if I could work in an environment with like-minded people that can stimulate to grow as a person myself and give me the opportunity to do what I think is best, then this would be the most effective way to go.\n\n*So, what is stopping me from quitting masterstudies and applying?*\n\nNothing.\n\n\n\nSo I tried to explain briefly how my proces went. Summarized I would say that firstly: the **Making sense**-video made me trust that *everything* in this world makes sense, that it's just a matter of understanding, which made me try to make sense of everything *new* that crossed my path. Secondly: the **critical thinking** made me realize that I should also make sense of everything that *I have been doing* up until now, which made me question my studies.\n\nI hope for some people this will be helpful, as it combines two main topics of the realtalk, and leads to the conclusion that it is more effective, for me, to quit my studies and apply, to hopefully work in a more stimulating environment that anywhere else.\n\nQuestions/ feedback always helpful.\n\n","createdAt":1476723495,"score":1,"author":"TimoKerr","id":"57yf10"},{"title":"Made the click. 5.45 AM.

The most logical thing to do is to show the people that its working right now. It's litterly the best thing i can do right now. \n\nI grew up in an dysfunctional family and therefore with a lot of fear. I created an ID to distract my true self so i would not be confronted with my flaws. I had comfort/safety as a core value because of this flawed worldview. \n\nThis old ID existed out of acting tough and creating an self that was not in line with reality. At the beginning it worked. But reality wil always come and get u. So everytime i got confronted with reality, i tried to flee from what i truly am by manipulating the mind. By creating situations that would create dopamine (drugs, alcohol), adrenaline (Fights, attention seeking) i tried to flee from my true self and hold this fake ID. This eventualy lead to me laying in a hospital bed 2 times for using drugs that created panic attacks. And 1 time for being in a fight where someone pulled an knife and stuck it in an main artery. I almost lost my life because of this. You would think this would make me stronger and live life on a good way again.\n\nBut, because of the low selfesteem on a fundamental level, i was still scated. Actually a weak organism with a flawed way of thinking, and because of that i always experienced alot of dissonance. I was so misguided, that i thought i needed the validation of other people. While the only one that could provide me what i needed, was the true self.\n\nSo i needed answers..\nI read alot of books for information, but nothing concrete enough to apply. Nothing that my mind could really grasp. I checked psychology books, spiritual books, like Eckhart Tholle's in the Now. It got me close, but i never got far because i missed crucial information about how to overcome this crisis.\nUntil this week.\n\nThis one person, the first chain of this neurologic revolution, Bachir Boumaaza, Also known as Athene, gave me the most concrete usefull information ever. SWITCH YOUR CORE VALUE IN TO LOGIC.\n\nBy learning that i am the reason why purpose exists. And that everything around me, the whole universe, is a projection of what my brains think it is, i know the '' external'' and '' internal'' are linked. We are one. And i need to care for it. I am the Universe and i shall take care of it. And be the best i can be. Al by applying this one true UNIVERSAL LAW, called LOGIC. \n\nIt's like there are still things to do. Things that i would use to call problems, because i didn't know i could solve them, but know i just see as things i need to do and act up on. \n\nI know now, that the thing i saw as '' my story '', is just an memory muscle that i can use to solve things RIGHT NOW. Nothing more. Thinking in an diachronic timeline is false when you identify with it.\n\nThis whole ID was an survival mechanism. One that evolution tried and now it came to the conclusion that it does not work. At the beginning it's uncomfortable, but you will have full clarity. It's so exciting but scary at the same time at first. Al of the people around you, just look lost. Everytime i bring reality up as it is, they experience cognitive dissonance. We live in an scared society and people are being controlled. I was selfish and lost in greed. Eating for the kick, instead of eating to grow. I did'nt care for other people, because i didn't care for myself. I see it al now. Al my mistakes. Al my flaws.\n\nI still got some things to do. Things i ignored for to long. But with this information and neuroplasticity. I know. I can achieve anything. And i will. I will make a difference.With like minded people. And live a valuable life. I am saved. And i want you guys to know that you will be to. Soon. If u accept it or not. Reality will come for u guys. And to be honest. Its not even that scary. Its lovely.\n\n\nIm free because I am.  \n\nThank you Athene and your team.\n\n\n\n\nAnyone who values this or has any questions contact me.\nU can mail me or have skype call as wel.\nIt's worth it.

I said to myself that I would try it the next day.\nIn the morning I had a feeling of excitement in my stomach and tried it out. I got to my core and saw that all my actions came from comfort and ultimately a lack of safety. Then I tried to replace that with logic. It didn´t work, but I felt excited almost the whole day.\nWhen Athene then was talking about it on stream I felt even more excited and while he was praising logic and all the time saying how you can trust it, I felt like getting really close to it and at one moment even getting overwhelmed by the feeling of having logic as a core value, so I instinctively blocked it.
